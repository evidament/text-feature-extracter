              "  'plot': '{{Plot}} The movie starts off in 1979 as a man breaks into a closed-off crypt. The grave robber sneaks into a crypt and immediately searches through a coffin for valuables. He nonchalantly removes and steals a ring from the decaying finger of the skeleton in the tomb. He reaches inside once more, but an unknown force slams the coffin\\'s cover closed, cutting off one of his hands in the process. In terror, the robber watches as the exit of the crypt is being closed off, trapping him. It then switches to present day, where a man with the name of Perry is being released from prison. His girlfriend, PJ, waits for him in a car nearby. Three other girls, Dorian, Adriana, and Morgan, are on their way to go meet them, but need to steal a car. They are driving away when the real owner of the stolen car shoots at them. They cheer as they drive away unscathed, only to realize that Adriana\\'s brother was shot in the head and killed. Although hysterical, they continue to drive to meet the others. They all meet and a thief, Gina, tells them about a \"job of the century\" that would get them easy money. She explains of underground vaults built during the Great Depression that became burial chambers for the wealthy. She shows them a gold ring and tells them there is more treasure hidden in the crypt down below. Equipped with backpacks, tools, two-way radios, and head-mounted flashlights, the group breaks into the north end of the crypt. PJ immediately notices something strange in the crypt when her backpack\\'s contents are taken out after leaving it for only a few seconds. Gina begins to travel ahead to check through the crypt and immediately begins to see ghost-like figures. Regardless, the group open a tomb and take the treasure. When Gina leans to steal off a necklace from one of the skeletons, she jumps in fright, claiming to have seen it \"open its eyes.\" They find several boxes of jewelry and begin to marvel in its excess. When no one is looking, Gina slips a necklace into her bra. Suddenly, they hear something that sounded like an earthquake and realize they are caved in. They try to find another way out but ultimately decide to dig their way out. The three girls decide to turn back while PJ, Perry, and Gina decide to keep going. The girls need to crawl under a wall in order to get back out. However, Morgan decides to climb over and an unstable wall falls on her, crushing her skull and killing her. Shocked by Morgan\\'s death, they decided to crawl back out but Adriana and Dorian saw an undead under the wall trapping them. Adriana starts to panic and Dorian climbs the wall to reach the opening in order to get back out but accidentally falls on the other side leaving Adriana behind. Gina splits off from Perry and PJ, who go into a vault and somehow become locked in. They follow a tunnel that leads to another room. Inside, Perry is attacked by one of the undead. In fear, PJ runs out of the tunnel and out the door that had locked them in before. She locks the door behind her and runs to find the others. PJ goes back to find the others only to find Morgan dead and Adriana trapped on the other side of the unstable wall, while PJ gets Adriana, Gina locates the injured Dorian who broke her ankle and needs assistance in order to walk. The girls meet at a certain point and decide to leave through crawling in a tunnel. However, while crawling through the tunnel, Adriana is dragged away by one of the undead. Adriana\\'s loss makes Dorian depressed. Gina heads to another route to find an exit leaving PJ and Dorian. The undead attacks them and Dorian is choked to death by the same ghost figure that had choked Perry. Gina and PJ continue forward but Gina reluctantly admits that she had been down in the crypts before. She explains that she was unable to find any jewelry and the ghost-like figures had never attacked her before; only watched. They leave behind the backpacks of jewelry and are able to escape through the other exit unscathed. They return to their homes. Gina finds the necklace that she had hid in her bra. She brings it over to PJ\\'s and tries to give it as a gift. However, PJ is furious and tells her to get it out. Gina keeps the bracelet and that night she is killed by the same figure that killed Dorian. PJ has a nightmare that Perry had become one of the undead and decides to go back down the crypts to rescue him. PJ travels back down the crypts until she reaches the door she locked. She opens it and sees Perry, barely alive. PJ begins to put all the jewelry back into its box and asks Perry if it was all the jewelry they had stolen. She then throws the jewelry back into the crypt. She attempts to help Perry out, but he is too weak to walk. When he gestures for her to go without him, she sees a ring on his finger. The ring is from the crypt. Before she could say anything, the undead comes and tortuously kills Perry right before PJ\\'s eyes.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'Saptapadi deals with the transformation of an individual so devoted to  the concept of rituals, that it takes an act of God  for him to realize the true spirit behind the rituals and true meaning of the prayers. Yajulu is a man of great conviction. According to him rules and customs, that have been passed down generations thus standing the test of the time, are there for a reason and hence are immutable; traditions are trademarks of a culture and customs, its signature. He does not mind losing his daughter for his principles. He is well into his twilight years which give him even more reason to not mend his ways. In his footsteps follows his Gaurinadha , gearing up to be a head priest at the local temple. Yajulu\\'s will prevails over Hema\\'s  wish and Gauri and Hema end up being married. The brilliance of Viswanath comes full fore at this point, when on the first night, Gauri witnesses Durga devi in Hema, and walks out of the room completely shaken up. This act of God triggers Yajulu\\'s thought process to seriously question, for the first time in his life, the validity of his position on matters that involve caste, creed and religion, justifying the steps that Yajulu takes one a time, from the first one in trying to understand Hema\\'s real interests till the last one, when he sees her off with her love interest on the boat. The crux of the whole film is contained in a beautiful conversation that happens between the characters played by Allu Rama Lingaiah and J.V. Somayajulu. Is caste a necessary evil? Is it evil in the first place? If the original idea that \"dharmam\"  dictates the caste of an individual, isn\\'t it abnegation of one\\'s own dharmam when one denounces his own caste? If structure  was the primary reason why caste was created in the first place, isn\\'t it working against the same individual to be caught up completely in the structure that he himself created? Which/Who controls what here? If the duties of the individual cannot make him realize the ultimate purpose of the same, what good is it, if he belongs to the highest order bestowed with the greatest privileges. Consider a brahman diligently offering his prayers on a daily basis, totally immersed in the rituals that traditions and customs dictate. The class of brahman, according to the Smriti, was created to act as a mediator/representative between the rest of the populace and their beliefs, performing the rituals, on their behalf, for the greater good of the society. The class was to bring people closer, in the name of traditions, rituals, customs, and above all, belief. Cleanliness and tidiness help him in concentrating on the task at hand. Now, if he is to stray away from the ultimate purpose of his duty  and instead indulge in the practices of cleanliness and tidiness to the extreme degree, that he starts alienating people in the name of untouchability, he starts moving away from his \"dharmam\", defeating the very purpose of his existence, which brings back the original question - which/who controls what? Is the individual controlling the caste or the caste has a greater say over the individual?'},\n",

Lena\\'s character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in Stockholm and is driven by a burning passion for social justice and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as \"religion\" and \"men\", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of concentration camps and a portrait of Francisco Franco, reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco\\'s Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena\\'s relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period. Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill , who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic lifestyle, meditating, studying non-violence and practicing yoga. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shot gun, but they soon start to make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They begin to fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of football players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally Martin Luther King, Jr. drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice non-violence. Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has scabies.

The firehouse receives a call about an old woman who is trapped in her apartment. When they arrive, Ángela and Pablo film the police breaking down the door. The woman becomes extraordinarily aggressive and bites one of the policemen. Meanwhile, the terrified residents gather in the entrance hall and look on as the firefighters and military seal off the building. A firefighter who remained in the old woman's apartment is bitten and plummets through the stairwell to the lobby floor. The camera crew, remaining Firefighter and the second policeman go up again and are attacked. The officer shoots the old woman. The camera crew remains trapped inside the building with the residents and continue recording in spite of the firefighters' pressure. Ángela interviews a little girl named Jennifer who lives in the building. Jennifer is ill with what her mother claims is tonsillitis. She says her dog, Max, is at the veterinarian because he appeared to be sick as well. A health inspector wearing a hazmat suit arrives and attempts to treat the injured, who become suddenly and fiercely violent despite their critical injuries. The health inspector explains that the time frame in which the disease takes effect varies by blood type. The health inspector also reveals that sometime during the previous day, a dog with the illness was taken to the veterinarian; the dog became violent and attacked and killed other pets at the clinic. The dog was euthanized, and was traced back to the apartment building. Jennifer, the girl who owned the dog, then suddenly vomits blood on her mother and escapes upstairs. The policeman handcuffs the mother on the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu. Pablo follows them. They find Jennifer, and the policeman tries to subdue her with a syringe that the inspector gave him, but she bites him. Manu and Pablo run outside where they find that the infected are trying to burst in the hallway through the textile shop. They are forced to leave the handcuffed woman and they run upstairs into an apartment, where the inspector tells the distraught residents that this unknown but virulent disease is infecting people, causing them to turn into bloodthirsty savages. More and more people in the building become infected, and Ángela and Pablo are forced to fight them off. Eventually they learn that there is a key to a door in the apartment building workshop, which leads to an exit via the sewer system. However, the key is located on the third floor in the manager's apartment. After finding the key, Ángela and Pablo appear to be the only human survivors, everyone else being dead or infected. Rather than making their way to the workshop, they are forced upstairs to the penthouse by the remaining infected. They then search the penthouse and discover that its former owner was an agent of the Vatican who was charged with researching and isolating a suspected virus believed to be the biological cause of demonic possession, which was later confirmed to exist in a young girl who was possessed. The agent kidnapped and brought the girl to the penthouse to conduct his research and to possibly cure her; during this time the virus managed to mutate and become contagious. The agent decided to seal her off, presumably to let her die of starvation and dehydration. A door to the attic opens and Pablo uses his camera to look inside. A boy jumps at the camera and breaks its light. Pablo turns on the night vision to see in the dark and discovers the sealed door referred to earlier by the agent on an audio tape. The agent abandoned his efforts to cure the girl after failing to engineer a vaccine and sealed her in the room before leaving the city. The girl monster Medeiros, now a ghoulishly emaciated figure, begins searching the kitchen area, unaware of Ángela and Pablo's presence. Pablo tries to escape, but trips and is viciously attacked with a hammer by the Girl Medeiros, causing Pablo to drop the camera. Ángela picks it up and runs, only to trip and drop the camera as well. She searches for it but is unable to find it. The camera continues to record as the screams of the infected girl Medeiros are heard on the tape recorder, and finally Ángela is dragged into the darkness, screaming.\"},\n",

The Lelièvres live in an isolated mansion in Brittany. The family consists of four members: Catherine  and Georges, the parents, who have no children together, but one each from previous marriages. Gilles is Catherine and her ex-husband’s son. He is a lonely teenager who loves reading and has a passion for arts in general. Melinda is Georges’ and his late wife’s daughter. She studies at a university and only spends the weekends at home, where she invites her boyfriend Jérémie. The household chores are excessive for Catherine – who owns her own art gallery – so she requires a maid’s help and hires Sophie. Throughout the film Sophie avoids using the dishwasher, refuses to take driving lessons, buys fake eyeglasses, and has trouble giving a cashier the correct change. The viewer finds out later that Sophie is illiterate and has a history of violence since she is believed to have killed her handicapped father, or at least not to have rescued him from the fire she might have set in his house. Once in the small village, Sophie meets Jeanne , the postmistress, who occasionally works in a charity and reads a lot. However, Jeanne proves to be a bad influence on the maid since she is jealous and aggressive towards a lot of people, including the Lelièvres. The two friends meet regularly either for a charity project  or for a film; television being Sophie’s main pastime. Sophie is treated rather nicely at the Lelièvres, who mean well towards her, but their patronizing attitude and the affection they have for each other create a feeling of jealousy and frustration both in Sophie and in Jeanne. This frustration reaches its climax when Georges fires Sophie for attempting to blackmail Melinda, who found out about her illiteracy. It is what triggers the climax of the film, which sees Sophie and Jeanne seize Georges’ shotguns and murder the family who were watching an opera on television. Jeanne leaves the crime scene and is killed in a car accident by the priest who had fired her from the charity she worked for. Sophie, for her part, walks away from the house after having wiped their fingerprints off the guns, making her way through the police squads going towards the accident. The end credits begin with the music of the opera that is being played back on Melinda’s tape-recorder, which Jeanne stole and put in her car.

In Bangkok, Emmanuelle finds herself bored and somewhat disgusted with the worldliness of her fellow French expatriates, until one day at a pool when she spies Bee, a Frenchwoman whom she is informed is outside of most of the expatriate circles. After taking a nude swim, she is approached by a pretty young girl named Marie-Ange, who asks to meet Emmanuelle at her house. Intrigued, Emmanuelle agrees. Marie-Ange arrives at the house and finds Emmanuelle sleeping, and takes advantage of the situation to feel the older woman\\'s body. Emmanuelle wakes up and they go outside to the porch. Marie-Ange asks Emmanuelle if she has any photos of herself and Jean having sex, to which an incredulous Emmanuelle replies no. Marie-Ange takes a French magazine with a picture of Paul Newman and begins to masturbate in front of Emmanuelle, who watches, fascinated. Emmanuelle confesses to Marie-Ange that while she did not cheat on her husband in Paris, she did have sex with two strangers on the flight over to Bangkok. Emmanuelle begins to pleasure herself for Marie-Ange as she recounts the tryst. That night, Emmanuelle tells Jean about Marie-Ange, expressing her amazement at the younger girl\\'s seemingly complete lack of shame, and Jean encourages her to pursue the friendship further. During a squash match the next day, Emmanuelle\\'s friend Ariane comments on her being damp from sweat, and begins to feel her up. At a party soon afterwards, Marie-Ange introduces Emmanuelle to one of her older lovers, a gentleman named Mario, who tells her that he will send a car for her the next night, but Emmanuelle is unimpressed. She spies Bee and strikes up a conversation, wishing to meet with Bee in more private quarters. Bee, an archaeologist, tells Emmanuelle that she is leaving the next day for a dig, but tells her to meet her at the klongs. When they meet up at the klongs, Emmanuelle follows Bee around, but Bee is uninterested in playing with Emmanuelle. Undeterred, Emmanuelle gets on Bee\\'s jeep as she is about to leave for the dig site. Back at the house, Jean is angered that Emmanuelle has left without telling him anything. Suspecting that Ariane is behind it, he goes and demands answers from her, but Ariane tells him that all she has to offer is consolation sex. An enraged Jean takes her on a table. At first, Emmanuelle\\'s affair with Bee is on rocky footing; they stop to go skinny-dipping on the way to the dig site, but when Emmanuelle tries to relax next to Bee while they dry off, she brushes her off, saying that they\\'ve already lost time. After reaching the dig site, Bee starts to warm up to her new companion, but throughout the day, Emmanuelle distracts her from her work. They finally make love, but afterwards, Bee asks Emmanuelle to leave. Emmanuelle returns home in tears, feeling humiliated. Jean tries to comfort her, advising her that the best way to get over Bee is to take another lover. At the squash courts the following day, Emmanuelle and Ariane argue. Ariane is jealous that Emmanuelle ran off with Bee, as she herself had hoped to be Emmanuelle\\'s first female lover, while Emmanuelle is displeased at Ariane for having sex with Jean. Ariane protests that it was more like rape than consensual sex, then advises Emmanuelle to meet with Mario, telling her that at his age, making love becomes so difficult that any man capable of it must be an artist. Later, Emmanuelle consults with Jean, who has decided to encourage the relationship between her and Mario by leaving her with him for two days. She expresses a desire to take Marie-Ange as her new lover instead, but Jean informs her that Marie-Ange has gone off on a trip with her parents - a fact that he knows because he has slept with her - and so Emmanuelle resigns herself to a meeting with Mario. At their first dinner together, Mario tells Emmanuelle that monogamy will soon die out. He tells her that she must learn to let lust, rather than guilt or reason, guide her when it comes to sex. This, he says, will lead her to greater levels of pleasure than she ever imagined possible. To begin instilling this lesson in her, he takes her to an opium den, where she is raped by one of the denizens while he watches. Later, Mario takes Emmanuelle to a makeshift boxing ring, where he talks two young men into fighting each other for the right to have sex with her. At Mario\\'s insistence, Emmanuelle chooses one of the men as her favorite, then watches as they fight. Her chosen champion prevails, and she is so aroused by his willingness to fight for her that she licks the blood from a wound on his forehead and then allows him to take her from behind. She soon climaxes and drops to the floor with exhaustion. Sometime later, Emmanuelle is awakened by Mario, who takes her into another room.

The people in the local village are fearful that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the local inn and asks the driver of the carriage that brought him to the village to take him to the Borgo Pass. The innkeeper\\'s wife gives Renfield a crucifix for protection before he leaves. He is driven to the castle by Dracula\\'s coach, with Dracula himself disguised as the driver. During the trip, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but is startled to see that the driver has disappeared, and a bat is leading the horses. Renfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a true vampire. They discuss Dracula\\'s intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula then leaves and hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. He faints as a bat appears and Dracula\\'s three wives suddenly appear and start to close in on him. Dracula then arrives and waves them away before he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the schooner Vesta, bound for England, Renfield is now a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship\\'s crew. When the ship arrives in England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person in it; the captain is lashed on the wheel and none of the ship’s crew is discovered. Renfield is sent to Dr. Seward’s sanatorium which is adjoined with Carfax Abbey. Some nights later at a London theatre, Dracula meets Dr. Seward , who is with a group in a box seat area. Seward introduces his daughter Mina , her fiancé John Harker , and the family friend Lucy Weston . Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theatre the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Renfield has become obsessed with eating flies and spiders and Professor Van Helsing  analyzes Renfield\\'s blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon chats with Renfield, who begs Dr. Seward to send him away, because his nightly cries may disturb Mina’s dreams. When Dracula awakes and calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him a branch of wolfbane. Van Helsing says its a plant used for protection from vampires. Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her, leaving neck marks similar to those on Lucy. The next evening, Mina tells of a dream in which she was visited by stranger with \\'red eyes and a white, livid face\\'. Then, Dracula enters for a night\\'s visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that Dracula does not have a reflection in a mirror. When Van Helsing shows this \"most amazing phenomenon\" to Dracula, he reacts violently, smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies. Meanwhile, Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he wraps his cape around her and attacks her. She is found moments later by the mouse maid and Seward, Van Helsing, and Harker retrieve her, while Dracula hides behind a tree. Newspapers report that a \"mysterious, beautiful woman in white\" has been luring children from the park with chocolate, and then biting them. Mina recognizes the beautiful lady as Lucy, who has risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but he is finally convinced to leave Mina with them. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs  to take care of Mina when she is sleeping, and not to remove the wreath of wolfbane from around her neck. Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the three men discussing vampires. Before Martin , his attendant, arrives to take Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to Van Helsing, Harker and Seward how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that because he has fused his blood with Mina\\'s, she now belongs to him. Van Helsing swears revenge by excavating Carfax Abbey and finding the coffin where he sleeps; he will then thrust a stake through his heart. Dracula tries to hypnotize Van Helsing, but without success. Van Helsing shows a crucifix to the vampire and Dracula turns away and flees the house. Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and Mina speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". Harker notices Mina’s changes, not realizing that she is slowly transforming into a vampire. A bat  flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then tries to attack Harker but Van Helsing and Dr. Seward arrive just in time to save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tries to tell Harker that their love is finished. Later that night, Dracula hypnotizes Nurse Briggs into removing the wolfbane wreath from Mina\\'s neck and opening the windows so he can enter. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield, having just escaped from his cell, heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula sees them, thinking Renfield had led them there. He strangles Renfield and tosses him down a staircase, and is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker. Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin, as sunrise has come, and is trapped. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina.

While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie , and her mother  in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman. The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman\\'s gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution. Starks is subjected to the experiments of Dr. Thomas Becker , a psychiatrist. In December 1992 Starks is injected with experimental drugs, forcibly bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie  at a roadside diner where she works. This happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. Seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and questions her. Jackie tells him that Jack Starks died on 1 January 1993 and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning her trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life. Early on 1 January 1993, knowing his time is fast running out, Starks slips out of the hospital and travels to the home of Jackie and her mother. He gives the mother a letter he has written. The letter outlines Jackie\\'s bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a cigarette and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks slips on ice and hits his head; bleeding profusely, he convinces two hospital doctors, who are sympathetic to him, to put him into the jacket one last time. Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007 - no longer a waitress, she\\'s dressed in a nurse\\'s uniform and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother — still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the \"previous\" future is not lost when Jackie says \"How much time do we have?\", a question she has asked him before.

Lila Loomis , sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken back to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond , who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel\\'s new manager, Warren Toomey . The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool . One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels , a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend\\'s place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable establishment before Norman was committed into a sleazy adult motel. Norman\\'s adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls came from someone claiming to be Norman\\'s mother. The next day, drunk Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Back at the motel Toomey yells hysterically up to the house at Norman saying he\\'s moving out. Later, a human figure in a black dress walks in and slashed his face and stabs him to death with a large kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. As Norman begins to reconstruct his motel, he begins to doubt his sanity when he spots a human figure staring out of the upstairs window resembling his mother. Shocked by this, Norman runs into the house and enters his mother\\'s bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. At the same time, a teenage couple, believing the house to be abandoned, sneaks in through the cellar window. As they were making out, they noticed a human female figure dressed in black pacing in the next room and heading towards the cellar trapdoor with a large kitchen knife. The girl tries to climb through a small window, but knocks over a pile of logs. As they try to climb out, the window slams down on his hands and the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic, but the door is unlocked confusing Norman. Minutes later, the sheriff arrives at the house and questions them about the boy\\'s murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It\\'s starting again!\"; Norman is aware that he is slipping into insanity again. That evening, Mary goes down to the motel to look for a bottle of brandy. In the parlour she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary\\'s mother and ask her why she alibied for him. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother; Mary has also been helping her. She was the figure Norman spotted in the window, and also restored mother\\'s room in the house plus locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and to have him recommitted. Mary\\'s growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience, leaving her to reconsider her actions. Lila becomes annoyed at Mary for giving an alibi to the police, because she is desperate for Bates to be recommitted. Mary, however, believes Norman to be innocent and states there could be somebody else lurking in the house. As she leaves, Lila warns her that Norman will eventually kill her just like the rest. As Norman enters the bathroom he calls for Mary, and the two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet and overflowing. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary tells Norman it could not have been him as he was in the attic, and tells Norman to make them both a drink. As Mary cleans up the mess, she is startled when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She screams and then calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. Mary then returns to her room to fetch her gun, which she has been keeping in her bag, and enters Norman\\'s mother\\'s bedroom. As she enters, she discovers a peephole behind a painting and looks through and finds somebody else staring at her through the bathroom wall. Norman rushes to her aid but is sad to learn that Mary has a gun, thinking it is because of him she carries it, which Mary denies. Norman goes downstairs into the kitchen, grabs a butcher knife for protection, and goes into the hallway to search for the intruder. As he walks towards the stairs he is shocked to hear a faint voice coming from the cellar calling his name. Norman then runs into Mary\\'s room and locks the door stating his mother is downstairs waiting to kill Mary. Mary tells him his mother is dead but Norman states he was wrong and that she is alive. Mary, who to herself thinks Lila is tormenting him, tries to convince him to confront her, but Norman refuses, claiming it is too dangerous, and tells her that he will protect her through the night. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary\\'s identity as Lila\\'s daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates  to be exhumed, to prove that Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila\\'s ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila will not stop. Mary goes to Lila\\'s hotel and tells her to leave Norman alone, mentioning the bloodied cloth and the peephole. Lila states her innocence, claiming she returned to her hotel after seeing Mary and their argument is overheard by a desk clerk. Lila tells Mary to dress up as \"Mother\" one last time to send him over the edge, which she refuses. Later, Lila drives over to Norman\\'s house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another human figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and shoves a knife into Lila\\'s mouth. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house; Lila\\'s body is not in the cellar and the \"Mother\" figure is gone. Norman enters the cellar and Dr. Raymond tells him about Lila and leaves the house to try and prove to Norman that Mary and Lila are the ones tormenting him. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, stunk with Toomey\\'s dead body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him hysterically. The phone rings in the house. Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\" but it\\'s actually Dr. Raymond who is calling Norman from the motel parlour telling him Lila used the office phone to place the calls but Norman believes he is still talking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified that Norman has slipped back into insanity, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman and arms herself with a large butcher knife. She picks up the phone and tells Norman she\\'s his mother and tells him to hang up. Dr. Raymond sneaks up and grabs her from behind as she is on top of the stairs calling out for Norman. She screams and plunges the knife into Dr. Raymond as he falls down the stairs to his death as the knife squishes into him further. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a completely deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother.\" A fearful Mary grabs the knife out of Dr. Raymond\\'s body and warns Norman to stay away from her. Norman keeps walking towards her even after being repeatedly stabbed in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila\\'s body hidden behind it. A shocked Mary is now convinced that Norman has been committing the murders. Norman denies doing any of the killings and thinks \"Mother\" committed them. She raises her knife to stab him but is shot dead by one of the incoming police deputies. The sheriff inaccurately places a story to the authorities believing Mary committed all the murders and killed Lila to protect Norman. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates\\' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool\\'s body upstairs to Mother\\'s room and we hear Mother\\'s voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers. Thunder is heard and Mother watches from the window upstairs.'},\n",

On her deathbed, Elizabeth promises an androgynous young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it along with a generous monetary gift which she will only bequeath to him if he consents to her command, \"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\" Both he and his heirs will keep the land and inheritance forever. Orlando acquiesces and resides in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries or so during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet, however, backfire when the poet writes a devastating takedown of his poetry. Orlando then travels to Constantinople as British ambassador to the Turks, but he is almost killed in a diplomatic fracas there. Waking up the next morning, however, he learns something even more startling: he has physically transformed into a woman overnight. The now \\'Lady\\' Orlando comes home to her estate in Middle Eastern garb, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman to begin with and therefore has no right to the land or any of her/his royal inheritance. The succeeding two centuries tire her out; the court case, bad luck in love and the wars of British history eventually bring her up to the 1990s with a young daughter in tow and a book in search of a publisher. The editor who judges the work as \"quite good\" is, ironically, portrayed by Heathcoate Williams - the same actor who denigrated her poetry as a different character 200 years earlier. Having lived a most bizarre existence, Orlando finally finds a tranquil niche within it.  {{cquote}} Also the film ends in its \"present day\" in order to remain true to Virginia Woolf\\'s use of real-time at the end of the novel.'},\n",

One of them reveals herself to be Elena, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen and a fellow Plumber\\'s kid. Elena explains that she had set up the negotiations to lure Ben out into the open, and explains that her father has been abducted and that she needs their help to find him. Just as Ben agrees to help her, the chips suddenly spring to life, controlled by a man hiding in the rafters. Kevin sees it as a double cross, though Elena insists that she is not responsible. While the dealers escape, Ben transforms into Big Chill and drives off the intruder. Elena escapes in the confusion, further justifying Kevin\\'s suspicions. Though Gwen quickly sides with Kevin, Ben is not as easily convinced. Arriving at their headquarters underneath the Bellwood auto repair shop, the trio, along with Grandpa Max, study the chips, learning that they are a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in; Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena\\'s father, Victor Validus, was an apprentice of his who was dishonorably discharged after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her. While Max is away, Gwen and Kevin hack into the computer files relating to Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that \"the Hive\", the hive mind intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet. Realizing that Max\\'s anger towards Victor\\'s betrayal may be clouding his judgment, Gwen and Kevin decide to aid Ben as well. Meanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor\\'s old laboratory. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they left Ship-It order slips behind. Other discarded files indicate that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips, and a picture shows Elena is close to the person controlling them. A mob under the control of the chips attack Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, having found an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks. Gwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips\\' control. He has a chip swarm attack Gwen and Kevin, which eventually wreck Kevin\\'s car  after a lengthy chase. Ben, overhearing the commotion and following them, uses Humongousaur  to defeat the swarm, completely demolishing Kevin\\'s car in the process. By the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. The group deduces that there must be a Queen  controlling the Hive, and by destroying her they will likely destroy the chips as well. During their search for the queen, however, one of the chips takes over Max. Pulling together, the group notices an anomaly in the chip distribution; while world population centers are all infected, the relatively remote Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration. The town is home to the central headquarters of Ship-It. With Kevin\\'s car out of commission, Kevin reveals that he has built a black and green car for Ben , called DX Mark 10  as a \"late birthday present.\" Infiltrating the factory, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena\\'s father and his body is being used to mass produce the chips; when questioned, Elena admits that she knew her father was the Queen\\'s host all along, but didn\\'t tell them because she feared they wouldn\\'t believe her just as the Plumbers didn\\'t believe Victor. Gwen and Kevin reluctantly suggest killing Victor to stop the Hive, but Ben and Elena refuse to consider it. Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls \"Nanomech\"  which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips. He enters Victor\\'s brain and battles the queen while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the drones. After a grueling battle, Nanomech electrocutes the Queen, and all of the other chips, freeing everybody from their control. In the aftermath, Max, after personally apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so.

However, when a cocksure young man named Eddie  deliberately provokes an argument and draws on him, Ringo has no choice but to kill him. Ringo is warned to leave the area because the deceased has three brothers who will be sure to seek revenge. Sure enough, they pursue him, but he takes them by surprise, disarming them and driving off their horses. Ringo then stops to wait in the nearby town of Cayenne where he occupies a corner of the largely empty saloon for most of the remaining film. It is only revealed later that he is hoping for a chance to see his wife and young son whom he has not seen in eight years. The local barkeeper, Mac , remembers him from the past in another town and alerts Sheriff Mark Strett , who turns out to be an old friend of Ringo\\'s. Strett also knows Ringo\\'s wife Peggy , and tells Ringo she has changed her surname to hide their past life together. Urging Ringo to leave town as quickly as possible, Strett nevertheless agrees to go and ask Peggy to come and see him. She declines, still fearing the notorious and hotheaded nature of Ringo\\'s younger days that drove them apart. While waiting, Ringo also has to deal with Hunt Bromley , the young local would-be gunslinger who is keen to make a name for himself, and Jerry Marlowe , a semi-retired man who mistakenly believes Ringo killed his son some years before. Ringo also meets another friend from the past, a bargirl named Molly , who eventually persuades Peggy to come and talk to her husband. Meeting at last, Ringo tells his wife that he has changed, that he wants to settle down somewhere where people do not know him, possibly out in California, and asks her to leave with him. She refuses, but agrees to reconsider in a year\\'s time if he will remain true to his word. Ringo also gets acquainted with his son at last, although he does not tell him of their relationship. By now however, Ringo has spent too long in town. The three brothers are still trailing him and arrive, but are captured before they can ambush Ringo. As Ringo makes final preparations to leave, Bromley seizes his chance. Eager to get himself a reputation as a gunfighter, Bromley shoots Ringo in the back, fatally wounding him. As Ringo lies dying he tells Sheriff Strett to say that he, rather than Bromley, drew first. When Bromley starts to say that he doesn\\'t want Ringo\\'s help, Ringo rejects Bromley\\'s words, informing his killer that he will soon know how it feels to have every hotshot and two-bit gunfighter out to get him in turn. An angry Strett tells Bromley to leave town immediately, and punctuates his order with a severe beating which he warns is \"just the beginning\" of what he\\'s got coming to him for killing Ringo. It is clear that Bromley will quickly discover  that notoriety as a gunfighter is in reality a curse which will follow him wherever he goes, making him both an outcast and a target for the rest of his life. The film closes with Peggy Walsh attending Jimmy Ringo\\'s funeral, making her way through the crowd around the church door with her son to reveal, quietly but with pride, what the townsfolk have never known&nbsp;– that she is Mrs Jimmy Ringo.

The Spirit dons his costume and travels across rooftops while delivering a voice-over soliloquy about the city being his one true love. A woman  is being mugged in an alley below. He manages to save her, receiving a knife wound that he barely seems to notice. The woman asks, \"What are you?\" The Spirit runs away, catching a ride from Officer Liebowitz ([[Frank Miller  and heading toward the flats. At the swampland, femme fatale Sand Saref  rises from the water and appears to shoot Sussman multiple times. The Spirit and Liebowitz find the wounded Sussman, but a flashback reveals that it was really the Octopus who shot him in an effort to recover two identical chests underwater. Sand and her husband Mahmoud  tried to flee with both chests, but the Octopus wounded Mahmoud and snapped a line connecting the two chests. Sand escaped, leaving one chest behind, which the Octopus retrieved from the murky depths. After the Octopus kills Liebowitz by ripping his head off, he sends away his cloned henchmen, Ethos, Pathos, and Logos , to take on the Spirit alone. His accomplice Silken Floss  drives up, running over Pathos in the process. She departs with the cargo, taking the view that the Spirit and the Octopus will \"be at it all night\" as the two enemies share a connection in their ability to resist physical injury. The Spirit is awakened by his lover Dr. Ellen Dolan , daughter of Police Commissioner Dolan . Appearing to be in perfect health despite his gunshot wounds , the Spirit is shocked to notice a gold locket in Sussman\\'s hand; a piece torn from Sand Saref’s neck earlier. Saref\\'s locket contains pictures of a much-younger Denny Colt  and Sand ; the two grew up together in Central City where Denny bought Sand the locket as a gift to satisfy her love of \"shiny things\", including the Golden Fleece of Jason and the Argonauts. They lived happily until Sand\\'s father was shot dead. Sand, who now hated cops, fled to Europe and has not been heard from for fifteen years. In a secret lair, the Octopus and Silken Floss open the chest, but discover that it does not contain the mysterious Blood of Heracles as expected and decide a trade is in order. Sand and Mahmoud visit the office of a high-class fence named Donenfeld , whom Sand paid to locate the underwater treasure. It is implied that Donenfeld gave up the treasure\\'s location to the Octopus to ensure his family\\'s safety. At Alice\\'s Hospital, the Spirit has fully regenerated and is as good as new; Commissioner Dolan angrily enters with young rookie cop Morgenstern  and calls the Spirit away to a case. Sand\\'s history as one of the world\\'s great jewel thieves is relayed to the Spirit. As the Spirit is about to arrest her, he is caught off-guard by her standing before him fully nude. Sand doesn\\'t recognize the Spirit as the presumed-dead Denny. She is stunned when he reveals his knowledge of her looking for the Golden Fleece as she shoves the Spirit through a window only to see him survive the fall. Octopus and Floss\\'s experimentation have led to the creation of a serum  that could grant immortality with which the Octopus injected himself and arch-enemies were born. After surviving the fall, the Spirit receives a tip on the location of the Octopus\\'s lair. Unable to break in unnoticed, he is captured and tied to a dentist\\'s chair. The Octopus reveals his own origin as well as how he and the Spirit became arch-enemies. Eventually the Spirit manages to escape, but not without sustaining a critical blow. The Spirit stumbles to the city docks and collapses into the water where he confronts the ethereal Angel of Death, Lorelei Rox , who has haunted his sleep. He becomes the only man to have ever wrongfully escaped death when he manages to gather his senses by remembering Ellen, Sand, and the city all needing him. As the Spirit swims to the surface, Lorelei vows vengeance. At the projects, Sand and her latest henchman fly in with the Blood of Heracles to meet Floss and a clone carrying the Golden Fleece. After a four-way Mexican standoff, Sand attempts to convince Floss to get out of serving the Octopus before she is killed by the Octopus himself. He asks Floss for the vase. Unable to take a side, Floss drives off as the Spirit suddenly materializes. The Octopus unloads with progressively bigger guns on the Spirit, apparently killing him off, but Dolan\\'s SWAT team storms the area and opens fire right after. Morgenstern blows the Octopus\\' arm up with a handcannon, to recover from the damage, the Octopus gets to the Blood of Heracles and prepares to drink it, but Sand shoots the vase just in time as the Spirit comes back from the dead, having used a bulletproof vest, and attach a grenade to the Octopus\\' chest, blowing him up into pieces, with Sand protecting the two of them with the Golden Fleece. Showdown over, the Spirit gives Sand her locket back. They kiss as Ellen looks on, feeling betrayed. The old flames bid each other goodbye and the Spirit convinces Dolan to let Sand go in gratitude for saving the world. Elsewhere, Floss discovers the Octopus’s severed finger crawling toward her. She picks it up and departs saying, \"we\\'ll start from scratch\". At dawn, the Spirit stands triumphant on a rooftop with his cat.'},\n",

Some critics have cited similarities between these two characters and film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Recurring characters in Vinton\\'s films dating back to 1980, Rex and Herb introduce several stand-alone videos of Christmas carols and standards and discuss the origins of each song relating to different holiday traditions around the world. The songs featured were: * \"We Three Kings\" by the Three Wise Men and their doo-wop-singing camels * \"Carol of the Bells\" performed at Notre Dame Cathedral under the direction of Maestro Quasimodo by The Paris Bell-Harmonic, a group of anthropomorphic church bells who strike themselves in the head with hammers to achieve their respective notes * \"O Christmas Tree\" performed by a children\\'s choir, showing various scenes taking place inside of Christmas ornaments * \"Angels We Have Heard On High\", an instrumental version of the carol with an interpretive ice ballet performed by a pair of walruses and six penguins. * \"Joy to the World\", a soulful rendition of the carol featuring images depicting African-American culture * \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" sung by the California Raisins  * \"Here We Come A-Wassailing\" sung by the entire cast Throughout the program, Rex futilely attempts to clarify the true pronunciation and meaning of the term \\'wassail\\', featured in the Christmas carol Here We Come A-Wassailing. As the show progresses, Rex is dismayingly accosted by different groups singing the song, though each version is lyrically incorrect. *Here We Come a-Waffling, sung by a kennel of dogs selling waffles from a vendors wagon. *Here We Come a-Waddling, by a gaggle of straggling geese carrying baskets of goodies. *Here We Come a-Wallowing, by a herd of slovenly pigs on a field wagon gorging themselves on an abundance of assorted fruits.  Though Rex is convinced his own definition is correct, he finds himself continually being questioned by the others, including Herb when he\\'s not busy excessively partaking of the various Christmas treats offered by each group. Finally, near the program\\'s end, a large truck loaded with cider-swilling townsfolk arrives on the scene, singing the correct version of the carol, validating Rex\\'s theories much to his delight. After one of the townies explains the real meaning of wassailing—going around the neighborhood singing Christmas Carols, and getting treats and cordials, the entire cast performs Here We Come A-wassailing, and then We Wish You a Merry Christmas as the end credits roll. This special was released on the Henstooth Video DVD Will Vinton\\'s Claymation Christmas Plus Halloween & Easter Celebrations in 2003.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 460. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar\\'s sword, Ambrosinus has then become Romulus\\'s tutor. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \"magic\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus\\'s father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \"Aurelius\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius\\'s men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer\\'s lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. Next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus\\'s help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue\\'s feet proclaims the sword was made for \"he who is destined to rule\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the Eastern Roman Empire - a Keralite warrior named Mira . They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire\\'s emissary  and the senator Nestor have promised safe passage to Constantinople. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer. Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in Britain, where the Ninth Legion  may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar\\'s sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the Alps and the English Channel, the party travels to Hadrian\\'s Wall and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commander. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonize the powerful warlord Vortgyn. During their stay in the small Celtic village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named Igraine. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was. Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith\\'s wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife\\'s and sons\\' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian\\'s Wall to face Vortgyn\\'s armies in one final battle. Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armor which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar\\'s sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn\\'s forces at Hadrian\\'s Wall. Aurelius, his men, and the archers pelted the infantry with arrows, while Mira, Romulus, and several Roman and Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the enemy at the gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn\\'s soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear and turn the tide. The two warring sides cease their hostilities when Ambrosinus confronts and burns Vortgyn alive at a tree-sanctuary of his secret brotherhood near the battlefield. Romulus kills Wulfila with Caesar\\'s sword, avenging his parents. He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon. Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, Merlin, takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name \"Pendragon\". The boy, Arthur, recognizes Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother. In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the Latin letters which, when read as a single word, read Excalibur.'},\n",

Max Rockatansky, traumatised by the death of his family, roams the desert in a scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special, scavenging for food and petrol. His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog, and a rare functioning firearm – a sawn-off shotgun – for which ammunition is very scarce. After driving off a gang of marauders led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, Max collects the petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles and moves on to check a nearby autogyro for fuel. The autogyro is boobytrapped, but Max overpowers the pilot hiding nearby; in exchange for his own life, the pilot tells Max about a small oil refinery nearby in the wasteland. Max arrives just as the marauders, a motley collection of cars and motorbikes, besiege the compound. Their leader, a large, muscular man with a hockey mask over his disfigured face called \"The Humungus\", tries to convince the settlers to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of his territory. A group of settlers attempt to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, rape and kill them. Max makes a deal with the remaining survivor, mortally wounded: bring the settler back to the compound in exchange for a tank of petrol. The man dies shortly after Max returns him, and the settlers\\' leader reneges on the deal; the settlers are on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return, and Humungus repeats his offer. Max offers another deal to Papagallo: he will retrieve an abandoned Mack semi-truck, capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the settlers use to store the fuel they refine, in exchange for petrol and his freedom. The settlers accept, but keep his car. Max sneaks out, joining forces with the autogyro pilot. Max drives the semi back to the compound, evading Humungus\\' men. The settlers want Max to escape with the group, but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave. However, his attempt to break through the siege fails: Wez gives chase in The Humungus\\'s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off of the road, wrecking his Pursuit Special and seriously wounding him. The marauders kill Max\\'s dog with a crossbow and attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special\\'s tanks, but trigger an explosive booby trap that destroys the car. Max is left for dead, but the gyro pilot rescues him and flies him back to the compound. Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound in the now heavily armored truck, accompanied by a feral child he has befriended, and with several settlers in armored vehicles providing protection. The Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan. Papagallo and the settlers defending the tanker are killed during the chase, and the gyro captain is shot down. Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against the marauders, who continue their pursuit. Wez boards the truck to kill the two, but a head-on collision with Humungus\\' car kills both Wez and Humungus. Max loses control of the tanker, and it rolls off the road. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the tank. The truck and its trailer are revealed to be a decoy, allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles. With Papagallo dead, the gyro captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the \"Great Northern Tribe\". Max remains alone in the desert, once again becoming a drifter, leaving the Feral Kid  reminiscing about him.'},\n",

As a young journalist in Chicago in the \\'60s, Mort Kondracke envisioned marrying a Vassar graduate whose status would facilitate his goal of becoming a top Washington journalist.

Fred borrows money from a loan shark for equipment, hires temporary workers and rents a warehouse to build the toys. Unfortunately, the warehouse is the base of operations for a couple of thieves hired by bank teller Oscar Baldwin  to tunnel into the bank vault across the street. They plan to steal a set of jewels known as the Vanderveer Collection, worth $37,862,000. The thieves try to scare off Ben and Fred, trashing their equipment and chasing away their temps which makes it impossible to meet the deadline. A large crate arrives from Ben\\'s friends Stephanie and Newton, containing Johnny 5, sent to help Ben with his business. Johnny can build the toys rapidly, giving Ben time to study for his U.S. citizen\\'s test. Considering Johnny\\'s thirst for data, Fred is sworn not to reveal their location to Johnny, believing that the robot would go nuts if he knew he was living in a major metropolis. When Fred accidentally lets it slip to Johnny that he is in the city, the robot leaves the warehouse to explore the city, annoys everyone, and inadvertently makes friends with Oscar himself. Fred, having learned that Johnny is worth $11,002,076.17, tries to sell the robot to a few businessmen. When Johnny learns that Fred plans to sell him, he escapes and wanders through the city. Johnny soon realizes just how lonely he is because of his inability to convince anyone that he is alive. Johnny is later found and retrieved by Ben from the police\\'s stolen-goods warehouse after being put there for trashing a book store for input. The two have a heart-to-heart conversation, and Johnny encourages Ben to ask Sandy out on a proper date. After an awkward start, Ben and Sandy make a connection. The thieves, pressed for time, lock Ben and Fred in the freezer of a Chinese restaurant, while Oscar persuades the overly trusting Johnny to help finish the tunnel leading to the bank. Johnny completes the tunnel, breaks into the safe, and unlocks the safe deposit box that holds the Vanderveer Collection. Johnny figures out Oscar\\'s true intentions, but after being chased through the city, he is savagely attacked and severely damaged by the thieves causing his system to malfunction. Although Johnny manages to get away, he is leaking battery fluid and losing power, a condition that will kill him in two hours unless proper repairs can be made. Ben and Fred manage to escape from the freezer with Sandy\\'s help, but when they return to the warehouse, Ben and Sandy are captured by the police mistaking them as being the ones responsible for the robbery. Fred escapes, though, and attempts to find Johnny. After a long search, Fred finds Johnny in an alleyway. Fred is startled by how damaged Johnny is, and helps patch him up enough to reconnect his main battery and memory, just enough for Johnny to make the remaining repairs himself. It isn\\'t until Johnny learns from Fred that he and Ben were locked up in a freezer, that the robot becomes enraged at the fact that they were simply locked up and he was attacked by Oscar\\'s gang after being merely used and seeks vengeance on Oscar. Despite his injuries, Johnny is determined to bring Oscar and his gang to justice. After a chase he corners them at a construction site near the Hudson River. Oscar\\'s gang is captured, but Oscar himself flees by stealing a boat. Johnny uses a crane to capture Oscar from the moving boat, who is then arrested and the diamonds are returned. The effort drains Johnny\\'s remaining power reserves and kills him, causing Ben  to frantically use a defibrillator in an effort to save Johnny. Ben succeeds, and manages to keep the robot running long enough to make full repairs. The final scenes show Johnny has become a celebrity, his face on the front pages of newspapers and magazines everywhere. As a result of this newfound fame, his look-alike toys have become a hot commodity, allowing Sandy, Ben, and Fred to go into business for themselves.

His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter\\'s phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man\\'s suitability for a relationship — which reveals that he is a \"Ditchable Dude.\" In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal\\'s eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw — whom he had previously thought of as loose-moraled  and slovenly — appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter\\'s Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \"What women want\" from a man — evidently it is for them to \"listen, listen, listen.\" With the help of the advice gleaned from the pages of Cosmopolitan, and to some extent in spite of it, Gopal and Mrs. Shaw  hit it off, and develop a warm, tender, intimate relationship.

However, when Chan goes to meet him during the night's performance, he finds the man dead, seemingly killed by a rampaging gorilla who somehow escaped from his cage. Lieutenant Macy takes charge of the investigation, assisted by Chan and his overzealous eldest son Lee, who also takes the opportunity to  romance Su Toy , the contortionist. On Chan's advice, Macy lets the circus continue on to its next stop, with the trio tagging along. During the train ride, an attempt is made to murder Chan with a poisonous cobra. Then someone tries to break into the circus's safe, but nothing is missing. Macy finds a marriage certificate inside, showing that Kinney supposedly married circus wardrobe lady Nellie Farrell in Mexico. However, Kinney's fiancée Marie Norman claims that she can prove Kinney was not in Mexico the day indicated on the certificate. Before she can prove it, during her act, someone shoots one of the ropes of her trapeze swing and she falls to the ground, seriously injured, but still alive. A doctor is summoned. Chan states that Marie is too badly hurt to move, so the doctor must operate on the spot. Chan asks everyone to keep quiet and clear the area, so as not to cause a potentially fatal distraction for the medical staff during the delicate operation. Meanwhile, Chan has noticed a newspaper article about a crime committed at a casino the day of Kinney's alleged marriage.

              "  'plot': 'The first part of the film\\'s story takes place in the year 1700 on an island called Casanga off the west coast of Africa. The island has not yet attracted the attention of the slave traders on the mainland, but its people are suffering fierce oppression under their hereditary queen Zinga - a tyrant, despot, and mistress of cruelty. What first appears on screen is a grassland landscape in which men of an African tribe are patrolling, with haystacks and rugged hills in the background. Into this scene there comes a bare-chested young African, as strong as a bull, looking around him cautiously. Next we see the brutal Queen Zinga, wearing a leopard-skin dress, a straw hat, and a shell necklace on which hangs a medallion, a symbol of kingship. Laughing vigorously, she is teasing a man tied on a wooden column, who is supposed to be the king of Casanga. Zinga takes off the necklace and puts it on the man\\'s neck, taunting him as a \"one-second king\" and trying to kill him straight away. Suddenly, a girl, apparently frustrated by the cruelty of the planned execution, rushes towards the queen, grabs the medallion, and runs off. Astonished, the queen orders her soldiers to catch the fleeing girl and to recover the medallion. However, with the help of the strong young man seen at the beginning of the film, she is able to escape from the soldiers and the two get onto a raft to row it to the mainland. Once there, they turn to a white slave-trader for help. The slaver happily accepts them into his camp and adds them to his chain. Then, along with all the other blacks the slaver has acquired, the couple is filled with anxiety and fear. Sent to England by boat to begin their new life, they are not sure what is in store for them. Time runs on and historical events unfoldd, such as the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807. But not until 1833 did the slaves themselves are free from the oppressing situation and the social status for blacks start to improve. Chains and handcuffs are destroyed, ropes and whips are burned, and a seemingly brand new story begins, centring on John Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. His singing impresses all his colleagues on the wharf. Children in his apartment block fall asleep soundly when he sings, but he himself doesn’t realized what use he can make use of his voice. In fact, what keeps hovering in his mind is the eagerness to discover his true origins and to help his own people, although he doesn’t know who they are. Zinga always considers himself out of place in London and is often blamed by his wife for being ‘not satisfied’, but never does he change his mind. Finally, one day an opera impresario hears him singing and tries his best to find out about him. And in a pub, while Zinga is being invited by the owner to sing the song \"Lonely Road\", Gabriel Donizetti, the famous impresario, comes quietly in from the door and sits in the audience, watching, listening, and enjoying the beautiful song. \"No more docker, but a great career\" Donizetti promises Zinga, who is shocked and surprised since he thinks he can achieve his dream of travelling back to Africa by this chance. They shake hand with each other and Donizetti leaves a card for Zinga to come to his hotel room the next day. Zinga can’t wait to go. The next day he dresses in a suit, apparently for the first time since he both walks and acts in a lame and inappropriate way. Zinga\\'s wife is also with him to deal with the hotel managers. In the end they find the way to Donizetti’s room and he starts a series of tests and introduces several skills to help Zinga to improve his singing. At first Zinga is reluctant to accept these instructions, like ‘breathing from the stomach’ and ‘singing from the breast’, claiming that he knows how to sing. And he fights against singing in a suit, since he doesn’t feel ‘free’. His voice significantly lacks emotion compared to when he sings freely with friends and in a pub about his homeland in Africa. But after his wife’s comforting, mainly focussing on the chance of travelling back to Africa, he is persuaded to follow those doctrinaire rules and techniques. After long training and practice, Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas. This brings him wealth and fame that he has never dreamt of. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, always being sarcastic towards his slave-born identity as his being referred as the Negro King. One day after a great performance, Zinga is instructed to give a speech about what he feels about his success. Not good at public speaking, he sings an old song derived from his long lost childhood memory that he barely remembers and has to put some words into it. In the song, he himself is regarded as a ‘wanderer’ and ‘hears the cold fell by his people’. John has a feeling that by singing the song he may find out some information about his origins, which means much to him. The result does not fail him. The song is moving and invokes one of the audience’s memories about the song. He comes to the dressing room at the back of the stage and talk to John about what he knows. John then finds out that his ancestor belongs to the island of Casanga, located on the west coast of Africa. The man from the audience, Pele, was the only white man to escape from the island since it was dominated by a brutal queen, and it is now ruled by a wicked witch doctor. And the song John sang was the secret song passed on by every king, regarded as the \"Song of Freedom\" of the Casanga people. Pele also tells Zinga the medallion hanging on his neck, which he got from his father and his father had from his great-grandfather, is the symbol of the kingship-----he, John Zinga, is the king of his people. Hearing that his people are still uncivilized on the island, Zinga’s idea of going back to his homeland to help his people became even more fixed. At this time Donizetti happens to come in and tells John some good news - a new contract to work in the great New York City Zinga refuses to go to New York to carry on his singing career since he considers his people bigger than his success. Donizetti is mad about Zinga leaving his career, but cannot stop him from crossing the ocean to come to the little island in Africa. When Zinga arrives on the island he, his wife and a servant are not trusted by the aboriginals, even though they have the same skin color and Zinga has the medallion which proves him the king, he and his fellows are still considered out-comers, strangers or even bad guys coming from the whites’ country. That’s far from Zinga’s expectation, which lets him down for a time. His servant wants to resign and tell him to give up, even himself thinks the place is too primitive and his people are too hard to change. But his wife stands on his side and encourages him ‘the worse things are, the more you can change.’ Soon he cheers up and waits for his chance in a shabby dome. And it comes. Zinga found out that the witch doctor locks patients up instead of treating them for the lack of medicine. The witch doctor also announces that when a person gets sick - no matter a fever or cancer - he’s dead rather than ill. To deal with this inhuman act, Zinga gives the patient Penicillin and tries to heal them. Some of the people start to believe in Zinga. They tell him “I’m your man, but you can be no king.” But this doesn’t last long when the witch doctor began to form various rituals to cast the ‘disaster’ the out comers brought to the island. What’s worse is that the people’s trust on Zinga diminishes since the patients he tried to cure all die. To break the superstition Zinga interrupts the rites, attempting to show that no taboos are going to act on him, but is scolded by the crowds. Therefore the witch doctor come up with a task of bring the rain. He claims that by rituals he can always bring rains to the island, then the gods and ghosts will be satisfied and cast no disaster and diseases to the men and women; yet Zinga points out frankly that the cause of disease is the bacteria and germs in the river and he cannot bring rains but he can help saving the rain. And he begins to illustrate the amazing life brought by technology improvement from the other side of the ocean. With the help of his followers, more and more and people of the clan believe in him. The witch doctor is so angry that he jumps up and down to try to scare people from getting in touch with Zinga. While they are debating, Zinga’s wife ran out and shouted to the witch doctor to support her husband. But that violate the taboo of not letting women to join the ritual and the witch doctor feels perfectly justified to put Zinga’s wife in the basement. Zinga, who tried to protect his wife, is also tied up by the army. They are going to execute both of them the next day. And by the moonlight, Zinga’s wife sang miserably to him to show her dismay. Zinga’s followers bring him his gun but he refuses it. He determines not to use force to hurt his people but convince them in other way. Next day the ritual is being held. The witch doctor performs different kinds of tricks, such as fire swallowing to intimidate his people, so that Zinga’s followers are afraid to rescue them. Both Zinga and his wife are tied onto a wooden pole, waiting to be killed, just as hundreds of years ago, the evil in charge of the island and win against the justice. Then the drums for the execution start, and the rhythm starts to sound increasingly familiar to Zinga. It’s the Song of Freedom, the secret song passed on by each king of the island. He can’t help but start singing the Song and sings so well that the crowds turn astonishment to appreciation and admiration. He’s the king!! Someone from the crowd shouts out and the people eventually believe he is the king and are willing to listen to him. Zinga wins against the witch doctor at last and achieves his dream. He goes back to America and frequently brings back medicine and technology of all kinds, helping his people to be civilized and educated. At the end of the movie, Zinga picks up his career as a singer again and performs the song he sang a long time ago, \"Lonely Road\" on a stage decorated as his little island, referring to his achieving his dream and the help he brought to his people, leading them to a better life.'},\n",

During the opening ceremony of the line, Conan Edogawa and the Detective Boys are driven by Hiroshi Agasa and pass under the Touto Line. Conan, having heard about the threatening letter, notices explosives connected to the Touto railway; Using his original voice to inform the police as Shinichi Kudo, he is able to stop the train and divert traffic away from the explosives preventing any deaths. Conan researches Asakura's political history for a clue on the culprit and learns the governor was in charge of the construction of dam in Kitanosawa, a fictional town in the Niigata Prefecture. Due to the dam's construction, the citizens of Kitanosawa were forced into a new town and their old homes were drowned by the dam. Since Asakura's trip to celebrate the anniversary of the dam is canceled by the bombing, Conan speculates information on the bomber could be found in Kitanosawa and plans a trip there. Conan, the Detective Boys, Ran Mori, Kogoro Mori, and Sonoko Suzuki travel to Kitanosawa and enjoy the day playing. They are introduced to a group of locals; their names are Keisuke Yamao, Mizuki Toono, Fuyumi Tachihara, Takehiki Mutou, and Shougo Hikawa. The group reveals they were all childhood friends and were part of the group which relocated to the new village. They also reveal its their first gathering in eight years since Yamao was in prison for killing Toono's sister, Natsuki Toono, in a hit and run. The next day, Tachihara's son, Touma Tachihara, awakens from his eight year coma with no memory of his accident. Later that day, Hikawa is found dead in a field. Originally, it was assumed to be suicide since only Hikawa's footprints were found in the snow. Conan reveals Hikawa was killed by an electroshock weapon. The culprit then waited for it to snow and walked away backwards to suggest Hikawa was alone. During a diamond dust caused by the sunrise, Touma experiences a flashback on the day of the accident. Conan investigates Hikawa's belongings and finds a newspaper clipping detailing a jewelry store was robbed the day before the hit and run. A cell site is destroyed by bombs leading Conan to hypothesis who the culprit possibly is. Meanwhile, the Detective Boys and Touma are hunted down by a sniper. Conan intervenes and leads them to safety. Taking a route towards the dam, Conan explains Yamao is the culprit. Yamao robbed the jewelry store in a distant town and drives back to Kitanosawa. On the way, he runs over Natsuki, a scene which Touma notices. Touma is then kidnapped by Yamao and sees the diamonds, explaining why the diamond dust startled his memories. Touma escapes but falls down a cliff leading to his coma. Yamao then buries the jewels in a property in Kitanosawa and turns himself over to the authorities for Natsuki's death. Unexpectedly, the dam project forced the town of Kitanosawa underwater. As a result, Yamao decides to bomb the dam to search old-Kitanosawa for the diamonds. In order to have enough time to perform the search, he had to cancel the Governor's trip and destroy the cell site to prevent the outside world from learning off the dam's destruction. Upon arriving at the dam, Conan is pursued by Yamao who intends to kill him. Yamao is then shot and incapacitated by Toono. Touma regains his memories of the accident upon seeing Toono and reveals he saw Toono push Natsuki off into the road. Toona professes she was the sniper attempting to kill Touma and that the death of her sister was an accident. Yamao, having set off the bombs in the dam forces them to flee. Conan diverges from the group intending to start an avalanche by creating grooves in a steep mountain with his motorized snowboard to divert the flow away from Kitanosawa. He is successful but his motor short-circuits causing him to be caught in the avalanche. He is eventually free when Ran calls Shinichi's cellphone causing him to regain consciousness to alert the others of his position.\"},\n",

Ortega knows that Earl and Val dealt with the Graboids previously. He informs Earl that there are more of them killing workers at the Petromaya Oil Field; he needs help to dispose of them. Earl refuses, horrified at the prospect that there are more of the creatures that almost killed him. Grady tells him that Ortega will pay him $50,000 for each graboid. Earl agrees to eliminate the Graboids, and Grady accompanies him. On their way to the Petromaya Oil Field, Earl and Grady are introduced to Pedro, the company\\'s chief engineer and Kate Reilly, a geologist. Ortega brings Earl and Grady a few cases of dynamite and an CAR-15. A man named Julio introduces a seismic monitor that will show Grady and Earl where the Graboids are. Grady builds a chain with a few empty aluminum cans attached to it to attract the Graboids. Earl and Grady kill 16 Graboids using dynamite strapped to remote-control toy cars. Another Graboid snags the chain Grady hooked to the back of the truck. The Graboid begins dragging them across the field. When the Graboid snaps the chain Earl sees more Graboids approaching on the seismic monitor. Earl calls up Burt Gummer, an old friend of his who helped him take down the Graboids with Val. Burt comes in with an army truck filled with explosives and weapons. The group splits up to kill more of the Graboids. Earl and Grady see another Graboid on the seismograph. Oddly, the Graboid is moving away from them, so Earl and Grady investigate. Upon reaching the top of a hill, the Graboid surfaces. In a panic Earl backs his truck down the side of the hill and into a pile of rocks, breaking an axle. They see the Graboid has not moved. Earl and Grady wait for Pedro to bring the Graboid back to the refinery. The Graboid makes loud, painful noises, and Grady and Earl see some of the insides of the Graboid are missing, leading Earl to believe that something emerged from it. While Earl tries contacting Kate over the radio, he notices that the radio\\'s transmitter has been damaged, then he and Grady hear another Graboid making a noise just like that of the one they encountered earlier. Grady sees Pedro\\'s truck coming up the road only to stop. When Earl and Grady walk to the truck, they see it is damaged and all that is left of Pedro are his severed arms. Earl decides to call for help by hiking to a nearby radio tower. Burt has become worried that his monitor is showing no Graboids and begins returning to the refinery. When Grady and Earl reach the radio tower they find it has been damaged. Earl spots a car near a small bar that Grady tries hotwiring. The two hear a strange noise coming from the bar, then see a creature resembling a smaller two-legged Graboid, dubbed a \"Shrieker\", emerge from the bar. Grady and Earl kill it, but three more Shriekers come for them. They drive the car back to the refinery. As Burt is trying to get back he is ambushed by Shriekers. Kate, unable to contact anyone, grows worried. Julio agrees to find them. As he is about to leave a Shrieker devours him. Grady and Earl kill the Shrieker that killed Julio and reunite with Kate. As they are about to leave another Shrieker appears and begins damaging their car\\'s engine, but Earl kills it. Burt arrives with his truck damaged from the Shriekers that attacked him. He shows them a Shrieker he caught alive, unaware that another Shrieker has stowed away underneath his truck. The four discover that the Shrieker hunts by using a heat sensor on top of its head, explaining why the Shriekers attacked the cars and the radio tower. When it consumes a piece of food it creates another Shrieker. While enjoying this spectacle, Kate, Earl, Grady and Burt are ambushed by Shriekers. The group plans to drive off with Julio\\'s car, but another Shrieker is blocking their path. Burt uses his .50 BMG rifle to kill it, but the bullet goes through the Shrieker and damages the engine block of Julio\\'s car. More Shriekers trap Grady, Earl and Kate on top of an oil tower and Burt in the bucket of a tractor. The Shriekers start jumping onto each other\\'s backs to reach Grady, Earl and Kate. Burt makes the Shriekers chase him into the storage compartment where his truck is. He is able to lock a door and close a garage, trapping them. However, this proves to be problematic as the garage is filled with food and allows the Shrikers to reproduce at a rapid rate. Earl sprays himself with a fire extinguisher to make him cold so that the Shriekers will not see him, so that he can reach Burt\\'s bombs. As he is walking the frost from his body dissolves and the Shriekers see Earl in Burt\\'s truck. Earl sets off a timed charge and throws it in the back of Burt\\'s truck. Grady, Burt and Kate pull him out with a hose, and the four run from the refinery. The bomb detonates the explosives in Burt\\'s truck and destroys the refinery, killing the Shriekers. Grady tells Earl that the Petromaya corporation owes them for 28 worms they killed. As they walk towards the remains of the refinery, Earl suggests they charge the corporation for the Shriekers they killed. When Grady says that they can open up their own Monster World, Earl says, \"No way.\", but Grady says, \"Oh, C\\'mon, Earl. This could be like your big third chance\".'},\n",

Donovan breaks up the fight and advises Tony to talk with a “psychologist” that works at the local aircraft plant, Dr. Alfred Brandon , a practitioner of hypnotherapy. Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene  - as well as his widowed father  - show concern about his violent behavior. Later, at a Halloween party at “the Haunted House” – an old house that several of the teenagers hang out at – Tony attacks his friend Vic  after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends’ faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon. On Tony’s first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist’s couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he’s developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future mankind has is to 'hurl him back to his primitive state.' Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner , protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a werewolf. That night, after a small party at the haunted house, Tony drives Arlene home; and one of their buddies, Frank , is attacked and killed as he is walking home through the woods. While Donovan and Police Chief Baker  review photographs of the victim and await an autopsy, Pepi , the police station's janitor, persuades officer Chris Stanley  to let him see the photos. Pepi, a native of the Carpathian Mountains, where werewolves, “human beings possessed by wolves” are common, immediately recognizes the marks on Frank's body, much to the disbelief of Chris, who balks at the idea of a werewolf.

Miss Ferguson tells Tony that she is pleased with him; Brandon has given him a positive report regarding his behavior; and that she intends to recommend Tony for entry into State College. As Tony leaves the principal's office happy with the good news, he passes the gymnasium where Theresa  is practicing by herself. A school bell behind his head suddenly rings, triggering his transformation into a werewolf, and he attacks and kills Theresa. Tony flees the highschool and despite the changes in his facial appearance, witnesses identify him by his clothing, causing Baker to issue an all-points bulletin for his arrest. A local reporter, Doyle , interviews Tony's father as well as Arlene and her parents, in the hope of locating Tony and getting a scoop. Baker and Donovan attempt to trap Tony in the woods where they think he may be hiding. Still in the form of a werewolf, Tony watches as the dragnet looks for him, but is surprised by a dog and ends up killing it. In the morning, Tony awakens and sees he has reverted to his normal appearance and walks into the town. After phoning Arlene , Tony heads to Brandon's office and begs for his help. Brandon wants to witness Tony's transformation, and capture it on film in order to advance himself in the scientific community. Brandon tells Tony he will help him and after telling him to lie on the couch, and injects him with the serum again. Immediately following the transformation, a nearby ringing telephone triggers Tony's instincts and he leaps up and kills both Brandon and Wagner, breaking open the film camera in the process, ruining the film. Alerted that Tony has been seen nearby, Donovan and Chris break in and are forced to shoot several times as Tony advances toward them.

Takeba does have visions of his wife dead, however, and the more he researches Mamiya, the more Takeba feels that he might be losing his mind. His wife\\'s strange behavior and concerns about his own mental stability lead him to have her committed to a mental hospital. When Mamiya escapes, killing a policeman and a doctor in the process, Takabe tracks him to a deserted building in the wilderness and shoots him. The film\\'s final scenes suggest that Takabe himself has become the master hypnotist, and that he is carrying on Mamiya\\'s bizarre work.'},\n",

When the woman wakes up a second time, Heiter has secured a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro . The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter explains to her that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a \"three-dog\", also joined mouth-to-anus.

Later, during dinner, Christian makes a speech to the family in which he accuses his father Helge of sexually abusing him and his late sister Linda. Helge\\'s family and friends initially dismiss the accusations as absurd, a joke, or a figment of Christian\\'s imagination. In a private conversation in the pantry, a seemingly baffled Helge asks Christian about his motivations for slandering him, and a Christian appears to recant from his accusation. However, Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim , a childhood friend who knows about the abuse. Christian then stands up and continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda\\'s death. Helge speaks to Christian alone and threateningly offers to announce in a toast Christian\\'s troubled personal history, impotence with women and his perhaps inappropriately close relationship with his late sister, Linda. Christian says nothing in response to the threat. Further exacerbating the tensions of the day, Helene\\'s black boyfriend Gbatokai  shows up, enraging the racist Michael who later leads most of the partygoers in singing the Danish song Jeg har set en rigtig negermand in a racist way to offend him. During a toast, Else makes a series of back-handed compliments towards her children, accusing Christian of having an overactive imagination as a child and asking him to apologize for his earlier accusation. Christian responds by accusing her of interrupting Helge during one of the rapes, yet not interfering with the incident, and calling her a \"cunt\". Michael and two other guests violently eject Christian from the hotel. When Christian walks back in, they beat Christian and tie him to a tree in the nearby woods.  Christian\\'s accusations are confirmed when Helene, apparently finally worn down by guilt, reads Linda\\'s suicide note aloud to the assembled guests. Linda\\'s note states that she decided to kill herself after feeling overwhelmed by dreams in which her father was molesting her again. In a fit of anger, Helge admits to the abuse in front of all the guests by saying that it was all Christian was good for. He then leaves the dining room with the guests stunned. Christian, who is drunk, faints after walking out of the dining hall and imagines seeing Linda. When he awakes, he learns from Helene that Michael is missing. We learn that the drunken Michael has called Helge outside and then beat his father severely, promising him that he will never see his grandchildren again. The next morning, Helge speaks to the group, admits his wrongdoing and declares his love for his children. Michael coolly dismisses their father from the table, stating that he should now leave so that they can have breakfast. Christian reveals that he is going back to Paris, and asks one of the waitresses, Pia , to accompany him. She accepts, and the film ends with the rest of the family and guests eating breakfast nonchalantly.'},\n",

They part ways, and we see that Leon and his wife Sonja  attend Latin dance classes that recently separated Jane is also taking. Leon does not enjoy the classes, and is seen savagely beating a drug dealer during a bust. He has emotional issues, but won't confront or admit to them. Sonja sees a therapist, Valerie  who has just published a book on her own daughter's murder 18 months ago. She and her husband, John,  are barely on speaking terms; he later refers to their marriage as held together by their grief. She feels threatened by another patient of hers, Patrick Phelan, who is having an affair with a married man and is forcing Valerie to confront her own issues in her marriage to John. Hoping to see Leon again, Jane purposely bumps into him outside the police station, and they have sex again, despite Leon's reservations about taking it any further. Her next door neighbour, Nik, is upset that she is seeing someone because he is friends with her estranged husband Pete, who wants to return home. Jane pairs up with Sonja in the next salsa class, which angers Leon; he ends their arrangement, which upsets Jane. She invites Nik over for coffee at the behest of his wife, Paula, with whom she is friendly, and offers him money as they are struggling. Paula starts to dislike Jane because of it. Valerie is coming home late one night and drives off the road. She is stranded, and makes several calls to John, who does not answer. Finally, she is seen approaching a car coming along the road, but never makes it home. Leon is the investigating detective on the case, and looks into her office and notes. Surprised at seeing his wife's name and file, he takes a recording of their sessions. Leon arrives home late but Sonja is not asleep: he asks her about her therapy sessions with Valerie, they discuss their relationship and he tells her of his affair which had just ended, but that he still loves her. Sonja is very upset and feels betrayed. Leon sleeps on the couch, in the morning Sonja says he'll be lucky if she returns home that night. Leon goes to John's house to interrogate him as the main suspect in his wife's disappearance. Leon starts a discussion about love, marriage and having affairs but lies to John when asked if he ever had an affair. Leon goes to Jane's house on police duty, because she has placed a call. Her neighbours are Paula , a nurse, and Nik . Jane was up late one night, watching Nik arrive home and throw something in the bushes across the road from her house: later she finds it is a woman's shoe. Leon and his partner arrive at Jane's and declare that the shoe was Valerie's. The police take Nik to the station and he leaves his children with Jane. Police call Paula to come in from her work. Neither Nik nor Paula knows that Jane made the police call. Although Paula does not like Jane, she calls her to thank her for minding their children. The police interrogate Nik but he refuses to answer questions about Valerie, repeatedly asking to see Paula. After seeing his wife, Nik calms down and talks with Leon and his partner. Valerie had car trouble and Nik was driving past; he agreed to give her a lift to her home but she panicked when he took a back road short cut and left his truck. Valerie had run off leaving behind her shoe. Paula goes to Jane's house to get her children, where she tells her that Nik is innocent of Valerie's disappearance. Jane asks how she knows that, and Paula simply replies that he told her. Jane asks if she can spend more time with the kids, but Paula forbids it, after seeing how Jane went over into her house and tidied it. Leon, his partner, Nik, and John go to the place where Valerie jumped out of the truck. They find her body where she had accidentally fallen down a ravine. Leon listens to the rest of the therapy tape where his wife had said that she still loved him and he bursts into tears. Leon returns home and sees his wife outside. Jane salsa dances alone, drinking and smoking, while Pete leaves her. Patrick is pained to see his lover happily spending time with his wife and kids. Nik and Paula appear to have recovered from the whole affair, and seem to have been the only honest and happy people of them all. The movie ends with Sonja and Leon dancing together seductively. Leon, who at the beginning of the film finds dancing with his wife difficult, now appears to be doing well. He looks Sonja directly in her eyes and dances just as she always wanted. Sonja struggles to initially return Leon's gaze but does so just before the movie ends.\"},\n",

Since the man has enraged the rowdy, the doctor pleads with him to marry her niece for her own protection. He does so and thwarts another attack from the rowdy during their wedding. Right after, he decides to leave for Madras to find his identity with his new wife in tow. Soon they find out that the earlier flashes he had are of the sculptures in Connemara Hotel and he used to be a regular there. After getting the bank account number he has used previously in the Hotel, he visits the bank and is once again surprised to find out that he was a regular to the bank too and has a locker with a large amount of money, multiple passports of him and a hand gun. While leaving the bank, he is attacked by an unknown assailant in the lift but he once again successfully maims the assailant and escapes, but leaves a shocked witness.

He contacts the number and barely escapes another attempt on his life but manages to meet the person Shanti referred who happens to be the police commissioner. He finally learns of his true identity. His name is Vetri and that he was a happily married to Lalitha , a police officer who teamed up with the commissioner to bring down a notorious hitman Zinda . Unable to find any information about Zinda’s whereabouts, they devise a plan to make Vetri go undercover and make him a bigger and more dangerous hitman than Zinda, hoping Zinda would get in touch with his fiercest competitor. The plan works and soon Zinda and Vetri become friends. But soon, Zinda learns about an undercover police officer in his gang through a spy and kidnap Lalitha to oust the spy. Vetri breaks his cover to protect Lalitha, but she is shot and killed in the shooting that ensues and Vetri is chased  but escapes barely.

The boy\\'s tribesmen appear and are at first hostile, but due to Jeffords\\' treatment of the boy decide to let him go free. However a group of gold prospectors are spotted and Jeffords is gagged, tied to a tree and made to watch as the Apaches attack the prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors then let him go but warn him not to enter Apache territory again. When Jeffords returns to Tucson he encounters a prospector who escaped the ambush. When he corrects the man\\'s exaggerated account of the attack, another man, Ben Slade Will Geer asks how he knows what happened. Tom describes how he found the boy and the following events. Slade is incredulous and doesn\\'t see why Jeffords didn\\'t kill the boy. Jeffords is later asked to scout for the army but refuses. Jeffords learns Apache, how to make and read smoke signals and plans to go to Cochise\\'s stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt Arthur Hunnicut who is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. The Apaches have killed many couriers and halted the delivery of mail for years. Jeffords enters the Apache stronghold with the aid of smoke signals and begins a parley with Cochise, comparing the mail service to smoke signals. Cochise agrees to let the couriers through. Tom meets a young Apache girl, Sonseeahray Debra Paget and begins to fall in love. The Apaches stay true to their word and the mail riders are able to ride to Tucson. However Cochise did not agree to full peace and an army wagon train is massacred. When the survivors arrive in town Jeffords is almost lynched as a traitor before he is saved by General Oliver Howard who recruits Tom to negotiate peace with Cochise. Howard says that his troops call him \"Bible-reading Howard\". On questioning by Jeffords about the biblical implications for the Indians, Howard condemns racism, saying that the Bible \"says nothing about pigmentation of the skin.\" Jeffords tells him to read the Bible for him, \"because I like the way you read it.\" Jeffords manages to broker peace with Cochise but the Apaches splinter, a group led by Geronimo  oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. Tom accompanies the first stagecoach to leave Tucson during the \\'testing time\\' of three months set out by Cochise. Geronimo and his renegades ambush the coach as it stops at a river. Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved. Tom and Sonseeahray marry and have several days of tranquility. One day when Jeffords is getting an archery lesson from Cochise Ben Slade\\'s son arrives, guarded by two Apaches. He spins a story about his horses being stolen by Cochise\\'s Apaches, he denies this but Jeffords asks him to go along with the boy to prove Slade, a famous hater of the Apaches, wrong. Slade and a gang of men from Tucson ambush Cochise, Tom and Sonseeahray. Jeffords tells Cochise to run while he attempts to hold off the men. Tom is wounded and knocked unconscious and Sonseeahray is killed. Cochise dispatches several of the men including both of the Slades, and goes to gather his warriors. The remaining men from Tucson head for Mexico as the army will now surely hunt them down as criminals. Jeffords regains consciousness as Cochise returns and prevents Tom from killing one of the wounded men. He still backs the peace treaty. Howard and the army pay their respects at the Apache camp, and assure Jeffords that Sonseeahray\\'s death will not be in vain. Jeffords leaves to wander the West on his own with the assertion that \\'the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace\\' and \\'from that day on wherever I went - in the cities, among the Apaches, in the mountains - I always remembered my wife was with me\\'.'},\n",

A resistance movement rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the environment. Dr. Azuma presents his discovery of Neo Cells, human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue. The Neo Cells are only found in the genome of \"a primitive ethnic group.\" He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori. A photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya\\'s  engagement to Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a booby trap. Azuma invites Luna\\'s father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma\\'s cell research makes Kozuki\\'s armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya\\'s ghost. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma\\'s lab. Tetsuya\\'s ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack. Azuma carries Tetsuya\\'s body into his lab. Tetsuya is resurrected, but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki\\'s residence. Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor. The Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves \"Neo-Sapiens,\" they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity. Kozuki\\'s residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is contaminated, and Luna falls ill. Tetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren\\'t terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government\\'s discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named \"Casshern\"-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-sapien is injured. A coup d’état takes place and General Kamijo\\'s son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered \"original humans\" of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts\\' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins. Burai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo\\'s son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she\\'s apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area. In the finale, the General\\'s son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai\\'s family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father. The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other. Luna rips out Tetsuya\\'s containment suit and a pillar of light fires into space. It ends with a monologue by Tetsuya while the screen alternates between the pillar of light making its way through space & crashing down onto another planet and flashbacks of happier times for the characters.

Hewes takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale , who explains that she has an offer for a show that would feature her as a solo star. Don tries to change her mind and it looks as if he has succeeded , until Don\\'s best friend, Johnny , turns up. Nadine reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and it becomes obvious that Nadine is attracted to Johnny. Angry, Don leaves to drown his sorrows at a bar. Johnny follows him and tries to persuade him to talk to Nadine, but to no avail; Don brags that he does not need Nadine and that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. After Johnny leaves, he picks out one of the girls dancing on the stage, Hannah Brown , and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. Hannah then performs a duet, singing a musical number with a member of the band  on trombone, \"I Want to Go Back to Michigan.\" The next morning, Don tries to turn Hannah into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an \"exotic\" stage name, \"Juanita.\" However, Hannah makes several mistakes at their first performance and the show is a fiasco. Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings \"A Fella With An Umbrella\" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. At the rehearsal, Don, realizing his mistake, decides to start over from scratch by creating routines more suited to Hannah\\'s personality.

Johnny soon arrives and takes Hannah out for dinner at which, after a comical routine by the waiter, Johnny reveals that he has fallen in love with Hannah. While Hannah does like Johnny, she admits she is actually in love with Don; she also admits to deliberately making mistakes when they rehearse so she can be with him longer.

Shetty successfully commits the murder in front of several gawking policemen, but as soon as he is able to outrun the police he is caught and turned over to the authorities by Shankar . Here we are introduced to the protagonist who works as a coolie in a shipyard, and sometimes at the airport. He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to get married to him as soon as possible but Shankar has bigger things to worry about. Shankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter by simply twisting his hand for a few seconds. The animosity is raised a few notches when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men to pulp. Weapons are no use against Shankar, who can jump 10 feet in the air and fell the 250 pound goons with a single punch.

However, she is saved by Gulshan, and she falls in love with Gulshan. This turns out to be a scheme by Bulla, as Gulshan marries Geeta and then hands her over to Chuttiya for his pleasure. Bulla gives Chuttiya 'Vitamin Sex' (a likely reference to Viagra, obtained from London, for him to overcome his impotency. However, Geeta dies while being raped by Chuttiya, and he disposes of the body in a jungle. Shankar's monkey, Tinchu sees this and leads Shankar to Bulla's bungalow. Shankar chases Chuttiya to Bulla's doorstep, where he is confronted by Bulla and his henchmen Ibu Hatela , Pote  and Inspector Kale. Shankar swears revenge on them and then goes his way. When he learns of his daughter's death, Shankar's father goes mad with grief and threatens Inspector Kale who he blames for being a henchman for Bulla the gangster. After a brief struggle the inspector chokes the old man to death. Shankar meets Bulla and his henchmen and promises them that he will kill all of them in 10 days. On his way back, Shankar finds an abandoned baby girl child, and adopts despite all the retributory violence that he is embroiled in. Shankar then goes on a rampage and starts killing all of Bulla's accomplices one by one, starting with Gulshan. Next Shankar finds Ibu Hatela attempting to rape a girl, and beheads him too. However, when he tries to assassinate the politician Bachubhai Bhigona, a sniper from another car kills Bhigona. Shankar is caught and charged for the murder, and is sentenced to a life term in prison, all on the same day. Shankar escapes prison the same night, and goes after Inspector Kale. Kale arrives with a contingent of about twenty white cars, none of which have drivers. Shankar is then ambushed by several Kung-fu trained goons with knives, submachine guns and grenades. To no one's surprise, Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale. After this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. In the iconic fight that follows, cots are shown hanging from the roof at several heights, and Shankar piledrives goons into them one by one, while prostitutes swing on the cots and stare in awe and amazement. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child, born from Haseena. While Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is an impotent & it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy & made him violently rape Shankar's sister.

Shankar is well prepared for this, and he takes out a rocket-propelled grenade launcher from the boot of his car and takes down the auto-rickshaws. The action quickly switches to a coal mine, where Bulla tries to use the adopted baby which he thinks is Shankar's daughter to gain leverage in the fight. Soon Bulla realizes that the baby is his own, he still uses the baby as a shield, Shankar rescues the girl with the help of his monkey, Tinchu, and finally kills Bulla.\"},\n",

The commander of the cavalry patrol is dictating a report to his clerk in the office of the fort\\'s commander. Held prisoner in the former commander\\'s office is the Arapahoe war chief, Hanu, who led the raid. He will say very little. And all the searchers can find is a single grave and a Colt pistol left behind by a gunman Hanu remembers as a \"quiet, lonely man...\" After finding the Arapahoes starving, a wandering gunman named Chuka  gives them the last of his food. \"For the Children\", he says. His gift impresses Hanu. Later, Chuka encounters a stagecoach with Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz  and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez . The Arapahoes arrive, led by Hanu. Everyone is prepared for death, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and simply rides on. Later, Chuka finds himself stranded in an isolated U.S. Army fort with the coach and passengers. The fort\\'s second-in-comomand. Major Benson, asks the stage driver about the \"saddle tramp\" hanging around the stable and is told not to let him hear Benson calling him that, warning him: \"That, Major, is a hired gun. He\\'s called Chuka and he is fast. Awful fast.\" The fort\\'s commander, Colonel Stuart Valois , is worried that the Arapahoes may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent  to reconnoiter, but his horse returns without him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that nearly everyone in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father\\'s ranch, he was beaten and run off and she dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice for being drunk when his command was attacked. His second in command, Major Benson  is a card cheat, while Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of the charge of treason. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach  is a first-rate soldier; he had served with then British Captain Valois in the Sudan and owes his life to Valois. Hansbach tells Chuka that when Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois\\'s command in the Sudan he blundered and was captured by the enemy. Valois\\'s and his unit raided the enemy camp and rescued Hansbach from horrible torture and certain death. But Valois himself is captured by the enemy during this raid and is left behind when his unit is forced to withdraw during the enemy\\'s counter-attack. Valois is horribly tortured by the enemy and it is implied that they castrated him during the torturing. Valois\\'s unit eventually rescues him but he is scarred physically and psychologically by the events. Hansbach tells Chuka because of this he will always serve under Valois\\'s command and never question his courage. Chuka tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to save her niece, the fort is under siege. Chuka agrees  to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. Chuka then pleads with Valois to abandon the fort, since Hanu , the Arapahoe leader, only wants the food supplies in the fort, but Valois is determined to find out if he really is a coward or not, even though he is hopelessly outnumbered. He has to put down an attempted mutiny, killing the ringleader Spivey ([[Michael Cole . That night, as they wait for the impending attack, Senora Kleitz goes to Chuka, and they make love. The next day, the Indians attack. Senora Kleitz is killed early on, as is Valois; with his last words, the colonel mourns the fact that he was struck down too soon, never to learn if he was a coward. With nearly everyone else dead and himself seriously wounded, Chuka hides with Helena Chavez. The victorious Arapahoes take the supplies and leave. As they pass, Chuka has his pistol at Helena\\'s head. ready to kill her to keep her from the Indians. But Hanu again recognizes him and rides on, letting them both live. The debt he owes this man is now paid in full. We return to the present where the commander of the cavalry relief column is finishing his report. He speaks about the grave and the gun and that he will not disturb the grave. Of Chuka - and Helena - there is no sign, but the inference is that the gunman has put away his past and taken Helena away, paying his debt to Kleitz.'},\n",

Later, while en route to his future bride Doña Jimena , Don Rodrigo  becomes involved in a battle against a Moorish army. Two of the Emirs, Al-Mu\\'tamin  of Zaragosa and Al-Kadir  of Valencia, are captured, but Rodrigo releases them on condition that they never again attack King Ferdinand of Castile . The Emirs proclaim him ‘El Cid’  and swear allegiance to him. For this act he is accused of treason against the King by Jimena\\'s father, Count Gormaz . Rodrigo\\'s proud father, Don Diego , challenges Gormaz, and when Gormaz refuses to take back the challenge or the accusation of treason, Rodrigo kills him in a duel. Jimena swears revenge upon her father\\'s murderer. Rodrigo then takes up the mantle of the King\\'s champion in single combat for control of the city of Calahorra, which he wins. Rodrigo is then sent upon a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals of the Castillian crown, but Jimena, in league with Count Ordóñez , has plotted to have Rodrigo killed. El Cid and his men are ambushed but are saved by Al-Mu\\'tamin, to whom he had previously showed clemency. Returning home, his reward is the hand of Jimena in marriage. But the marriage is not consummated and she removes herself to a convent. King Ferdinand dies, and his eldest son, Prince Sancho , becomes king. The younger son, Prince Alfonso ([[John Fraser , also desires the throne; his sister, Princess Urraca  secretly has Sancho assassinated. At Alfonso\\'s coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Since he had no part in it as his sister was responsible, he swears so, but has Rodrigo banished for his impudence. Jimena\\'s love for El Cid is rekindled and she chooses banishment with him. Rodrigo is later called into service of the king once again, to protect Castille from Yusuf\\'s North African army. He allies himself with the other Emirs who fear Ben Yusuf and at Valencia, Rodrigo relieves the city of the wicked Emir Al-Kadir, who had betrayed him. The Emir Al-Mu\\'tamin and the Valencians offer the crown to ‘The Cid’, but he refuses it and sends the crown to King Alfonso. Rodrigo then repels the invading army of Ben Yusuf, but is wounded in battle by an arrow before the final victory. If the arrow is removed, there is a chance that he will live, but he will not be able to lead his army. El Cid obtains a promise from Jimena to not remove it, knowing that this will kill him. He intends to ride out, even if dead. King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. The morning after El Cid dies, his body is secured upon his horse and sent out at the head of his army with King Alfonso and Emir Al-Mu\\'tamin on either side of his horse. When Yusuf\\'s army see him with his eyes still open, they believe that El Cid\\'s ghost has come back from the dead. Babieca, his horse, tramples on and kills Ben Yusuf, who is too terrified to fight. The invading North African army is completely defeated.

During the escape, Deacon  manages to disarm a German soldier but does not shoot him - even at the insistence of medic Gould . Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Kendrick  and Gunderson . Gunderson explains it would be better to hide out until the Allies retake the area and the four hide out in an abandoned building. When a German patrol comes along, the soldiers hide under the floor. While there Deacon loosely translates a German message about a downed plane in the area. Leaving after the Germans, the Americans find a British pilot Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley . Winley explains he has important intelligence he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. While on point, Deacon has a hallucination and breaks down. Gunderson explains that Deacon had inadvertently killed two women and six children recently. Gould begins to criticize Deacon for not shooting the German and for being religious. Deacon offers him his Book of Mormon which Gould refuses. Deacon says that Gould is asking too many questions for someone who is not interested in faith. Shortly afterwards, Kendrick falls through the roof of an old building that had been covered by the snow. Looking for shelter, Gunderson enters a house and finds a woman and girl who speak French, Catherine and Sophie Theary. A coming snow storm causes Gunderson to surmise that the Germans will be pinned down and immobilized. He suggests staying the night but Winley insists that he must get the information to the Allied troops and leaves during the storm. The others are sure he will die in the cold. Catherine brings some bread to the soldiers. While with the soldiers, two Germans arrive and Catherine talks to them. One German starts scouting the building while the other attempts to rape Catherine. She yells and Deacon kills one German as the other runs into the woods. Winley returns with this German as his prisoner. Deacon recognizes the German as Rudolph \"Rudi\" Gertz, an acquaintance from his time serving an LDS mission in Berlin. In the morning, Deacon has let Rudi go, but Rudi has told them where the Germans lines are and a way to get through them. With captured weapons they set out but soon encounter a small group of German soldiers. Gunderson is fatally shot by a sniper, whom Deacon then kills. More Germans attack and Winley is hit in the leg. During the firefight the Allied group is split in two. While carrying Winley, Kendrick is shot in the stomach and dies. Winley kills the German and, trying to hobble away, falls into a river. Deacon and Gould find him. While they care for Winley, Rudi finds them and tells them where there is a jeep, and goes off in the direction of the pursuing Germans. The three remaining Allied soldiers, now dressed as German soldiers, get in the jeep and head toward the German lines. They manage to talk their way past a German guard  but when they veer towards the American lines the Germans open fire. Speeding toward the safety of the American lines  the jeep is overturned by mortar fire. Deacon gives covering fire as Gould and Winley head for safety. Deacon is killed by a sniper but the other two make it through and the important intelligence is passed onto to headquarters.

Madam Yeung and Peter tail them to a seaport that night, where a shipment has just arrived from Hong Kong. Chinese workmen load crates into the drug dealers\\' truck. Madam Yeung, in defiance of Peter, acrobatically infiltrates the docks and enters the truck, but is caught by one of the workmen, Luk Wan-ting . She convinces him that she\\'s a stowaway illegal immigrant from Hong Kong, and he takes her to his nearby attic apartment, where he gives her some money to help her, as he and his brother too were illegal immigrants for seven years. He has just obtained legal ID cards for both of them. She tries to stealthily check in with Peter, who is tailing the cocaine dealers to an unknown location, but Luk grows suspicious and catches her. Just then Luk\\'s brother Ming  crashes in through a skylight, pursued by six armed thugs to whom he owes $20,000 due to his gambling addiction. Luk attacks the thugs to save Ming, revealing that he has some martial arts skill. Madam Yeung joins the fight against the thugs. Together they drive the thugs away. She returns Luk\\'s money and leaves. The next morning, Madam Yeung realizes that one of the Chinese cocaine dealers is following her. She ambushes him, and they fight.

He comes over to say hi to Donnie, inadvertently obscuring Donnie\\'s view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside in search of the criminal, but are ambushed by a couple martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them. Elsewhere, Peter has tailed the cocaine dealers to a mining corporation warehouse on the docks, where they sell cocaine to a Caucasian gang. Peter attempts to arrest them all, revealing that the Caucasians\\' leader is a CIA officer named Mr. Robinson, which the Hong Kong dealers didn\\'t know. He photographs Mr. Robinson in the act of the cocaine deal. Mr. Robinson draws a concealed shotgun and shoots Peter in the torso, and then he and his men shoot all the Chinese dealers dead . They try to retrieve the camera, but Peter is still alive, and he flees the warehouse even as Mr. Robinson shoots him again. Outside, he crashes into Luk, hands him his gun and the negative of the photo, and tells him to give it to the police. Then Mr. Robinson and his men catch up and shoot him dead. They open fire at Luk too, but Luk flees behind a shed and accidentally drops the negative into the ocean. Mr. Robinson and his men continue to pursue Luk and shoot at him, but Luk is rescued at the last moment by the arrival of the Seattle police. Mr. Robinson and his men jump into their car and escape. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and the other officers drive up and find their partner\\'s corpse and Luk with a gun. They arrest Luk. At the Seattle police station, Donnie interrogates Luk, thinking he was a member of the Hong Kong gang and convinced that he hid the negative somewhere, while Luk proclaims his innocence. Donnie\\'s interrogation is interrupted by a higher ranking officer, and Donnie leaves the interrogation room. The new officer threatens Luk to give him the negative, and brutally beats him with a baton when he claims he doesn\\'t know where it is. Luk defends himself and knocks out the corrupt officer, then puts on his uniform and sneaks out of the police station. Luk goes to Ming\\'s apartment, and Ming gives up his ID card, which Luk worked for seven years to get him, to get $3000 for a seat on a ship to take Luk back to Hong Kong that night. It is revealed that Luk is skilled at repairing Ming\\'s TV antenna. Just then a couple of gunmen enter the apartment in search of Luk. Ming sacrifices his life to save Luk, while Luk keeps trying to save Ming until he dies, then finally flees. Just as Luk reaches the apartment complex\\'s exit, Madam Yeung and Donnie pull up outside, having come to arrest him. Luk runs back in. Madam Yeung and Donnie split up to search the apartment complex. Donnie sees Luk and chases him onto the rooftop, where Luk ambushes him, and they fight. Donnie almost immediately gets the advantage and beats up Luk, who flees, jumping from rooftops with Donnie in hot pursuit. Luk jumps onto a Budget truck and rides it away. Donnie, still convinced that Luk is a cocaine dealer, draws his gun and takes aim, but Madam Yeung appears and knocks it away to save the potentially innocent Luk, who escapes. Back at the Seattle police station, Donnie\\'s superior orders him off the case because he has no faith in him, and replaces him with Michael. Donnie requests to stay on the case as Michael\\'s partner, and Michael convinces their superior to allow it. That night, Luk goes to board the ship to Hong Kong. He has to sell his ID card as well to buy passage. Donnie gets information that Luk escaped to Hong Kong on that ship, and he, Michael, and Madam Yeung fly to Hong Kong, arriving before the ship. When the ship reaches port, the Hong Kong police board it to arrest Luk. Luk flees to the other side of the ship and jumps off onto a cargo dock, then lies atop a giant cargo container as a forklift carries it through the police barrier. Donnie climbs atop a tall stack of cargo containers and sees Luk escape. Luk goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, to tell her that he\\'s returned and will see her soon. Donnie catches up with him and chases him to a beach, where they fight. Madam Yeung arrives and yells at Donnie to stop beating Luk, finally pointing her gun at him. Donnie knocks her gun into the ocean, and she attacks him. Their fight is broken up by Michael and the Hong Kong police, and Luk is arrested again. Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong police officer ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police station in the back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer attacked him in the station. Michael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back to the U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through the driver\\'s window, knocking out the driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through the window into the back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance\\'s inhaler and uses it to avoid the gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight on the roof of the speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through the side windows, and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings to the ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb over to the broken driver\\'s window and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging to the grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives. Madam Yeung organizes a Hong Kong police search team for them. Meanwhile, Luk and Michael are tortured by being tied up in a freezer. A thug played by Paul Wong interrogates, beats, and further tortures them, seeking the negative. Michael manages to free himself from his bonds and knock out the thug, then free Luk. Michael tries to convince Luk to give him the negative, and Luk begins to tell him about it, but they\\'re interrupted by the arrival of a thug played by Michael Woods. Luk and Michael get separated, and Luk hides in a parked car. Michael meets up with three thugs - John Salvitti, Michael Woods, and Stephan Berwick. It is revealed that he is their boss. Meanwhile, Luk uses his electronics skills to get the car\\'s radio working, and he contacts the Hong Kong police headquarters, who locate the signal\\'s source and come to rescue him. Then Michael finds Luk and asks for the negative again. Luk tells him that he lost the negative, and he doesn\\'t know where, but he saw the murderer of the American cop and could recognize him. Michael surreptitiously reaches for his gun, but just then Madam Yeung and the Hong Kong police arrive. They take Luk back into custody, and Michael declares that he\\'s going to extradite him back to the U.S. Madam Yeung drives Luk toward the airport to be flown back to the U.S. On the way, Luk requests to see his mother before leaving. Madam Yeung is reluctantly convinced, and she drives Luk to his mother\\'s home, where they have an emotional conversation as Luk and his mother are overjoyed to see each other, but Luk\\'s mother is devastated by learning that he is suspected of a crime severe enough to involve U.S. police. They also meet up with Donnie. Madam Yeung, Luk, and Donnie walk outside and are attacked by Salvitti, who rides up on a motorcycle and opens fire with an automatic rifle, shooting Luk in the heart. Madam Leung and Donnie carry Luk and flee. Donnie lures Salvitti away while Madam Leung gets Luk to the nearest hospital. Donnie ambushes Salvitti and fights him. Salvitti is almost a match for him, but Donnie manages to beat him up and arrest him. The next morning, at the hospital, Luk is unconscious but past the most dangerous period and will likely recover. Madam Yeung and Donnie argue, with Donnie accusing Madam Yeung of too much sentimentality, particularly for having let Luk see his mother and thereby exposing him to danger, and Madam Yeung accusing Donnie of too much impulsiveness and egotistical attitude. Then Madam Yeung\\'s superior enters the room and berates her for granting Luk\\'s request, but Donnie defends her by claiming responsibility for the decision. Afterward she tries to thank him, but he avoids her. Michael meets with the Chinese cocaine dealer and tells him that his cocaine and Michael\\'s money were both lost to the police, but he promises revenge. The dealer drives off, accompanied by a tough-looking Caucasian woman . Later, at the Hong Kong police headquarters, Donnie interrogates Salvitti while Madam Yeung and Michael watch. Donnie reveals that Salvitti has a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which he explains is a sign of the Field Troop of the U.S. Navy – the symbol of Black Fox, Troop 3. According to the Pentagon\\'s records, on October 26, 1979, was entirely destroyed in the civil war of Nicaragua, but a suspect killed in this case in the U.S. the previous month also had this tattoo. Salvitti taunts Donnie, who brutally beats him. Salvitti surreptitiously injects himself with a concealed needle and dies, making it look like he died from Donnie\\'s beating. Later that day, Michael takes Donnie to the airport, telling him the Hong Kong police complained that Donnie\\'s violence caused Salvitti\\'s death, so Michael has to transfer him back to Seattle. Donnie tricks Michael into thinking he\\'s left, but then doubles back, suspicious. That night, Michael takes Madam Yeung to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the Chinese cocaine dealer plants a bomb under her car. Madam Yeung narrowly avoids the explosion and attacks the dealer, but his female bodyguard drives up and rescues him, and they escape. Later that night, Stephan Berwick rappels down the outside of the hospital and shoots what he thinks is Luk with an automatic rifle through the window, but it\\'s a decoy dummy, and the doctors in the room reveal themselves to be disguised Hong Kong policemen, and they draw their guns and return fire. Berwick flees. Madam Yeung sends the officers after him, then goes to the room where Luk actually is and checks up on him. He\\'s still unconscious. The room is attacked by Paul Wong, who takes Madam Yeung by surprise and stabs her in the neck with a tranquilizer syringe, then draws a large knife and attacks her as she struggles to stay awake. The doctor tries to interfere, but Paul stabs him to death, cuts Madam Yeung, and knocks her out of the way. He tries to kill the unconscious Luk, but Madam Yeung saves him for a few more seconds. Finally he knocks her back again and she\\'s too close to unconsciousness to move, but at the last moment Donnie bursts into the room and attacks Paul. They fight briefly before Donnie kills him. The next morning, Madam Yeung is recuperating in a church along with Donnie and the still-unconscious Luk. She asks him why he didn\\'t return to the U.S., and he explains that he felt something was wrong about the death of Salvitti. She knows that he suspects Michael is one of the criminals, but he doesn\\'t want to admit it, as they\\'re good friends. They argue, but then come to an understanding. Just then Luk wakes and explains all that happened from his perspective. Later that day, Madam Yeung\\'s superior orders her to let Michael take Luk back to the U.S. Madam Yeung secretly organizes a Hong Kong police raid of the Chinese drug dealers\\' lab, but tells Michael, who comes with her, that they\\'re just going to get Luk. They enter the lab, and a huge gunfight breaks out. Madam Yeung pursues the ringleader into a metal stairwell and kills him. His female bodyguard attacks her, and they have a long and brutal fight. Finally the female bodyguard falls down an elevator shaft to her death, despite Madam Yeung\\'s last-minute attempt to save her. As a consequence of Madam Yeung\\'s insubordinate actions, the Hong Kong police chief is forced to declare her under arrest. However, she hasn\\'t returned with Michael. Meanwhile, back at the church, Luk identifies Mr. Robinson to Donnie, who recognizes him as a CIA officer. Madam Yeung goes to Luk\\'s mother\\'s house. There she is ambushed by Michael Woods and Stephan Berwick, who beat her up and capture her, having already abducted Luk\\'s mother. She\\'s rescued by the arrival of a Hong Kong police squad, who chase Michael and Stephan away. One officer stays behind to arrest Madam Yeung, but she knocks him out and flees. Donnie confronts Michael about his suspicions. Michael reveals that he is a CIA officer, and that his division, which includes Mr. Robinson, sells drugs to raise money in order to support a Latin American anti-government force, which is in the U.S.\\'s political interests. He invites Donnie to join them. Donnie refuses, and Michael reveals a deadly syringe concealed in his shoe and unleashes a flurry of quick, vicious kicks at Donnie, who avoids them all and starts to gain the advantage until Michael draws a gun. Donnie flees on foot into the streets, but the hidden tape on which he recorded Michael\\'s confession is destroyed. Michael sees that there was a tape, but doesn\\'t realize it\\'s broken. Michael sends Woods and Berwick after Donnie on motorcycles. Donnie narrowly avoids them for a brief, stunt-filled chase, and then he jumps up and kicks Berwick off his motorcycle and steals it. A long motorcycle chase and fight ensues between him and Woods throughout the streets, hills, and obstacle-filled back alleys of Hong Kong. Finally Donnie gains the advantage, but Woods escapes. Donnie meets up with Madam Yeung, but Michael has framed Donnie for a crime, and now both of them are pursued by the police in a desperate foot chase through a parking garage. They hide in a car trunk, but are found by the Hong Kong police chief. However, the chief conceals them and lets them go, warning them that he can\\'t help them a second time. Back in the church, Donnie, Madam Yeung, and Luk re-convene, and Madam Yeung reveals that Luk\\'s mother has been abducted. Luk re-bandages his chest wound and prepares to go rescue her. On Madam Yeung\\'s suggestion, they call Michael and offer to trade the incriminating tape for Luk\\'s mother. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and Luk walk into Michael\\'s building as Michael watches them on a security camera. A steel gate crashes down behind them. They meet with Michael and his sadistic Chinese bodyguard. Donnie throws the tape to Michael, who catches it, then draws a gun to kill them all. Madam Yeung draws a remote trigger switch and declares that the \"tape\" Michael is holding is a bomb. She makes Michael unload his gun and throw it away, and Luk demands the return of his mother. On Michael\\'s order, his bodyguard opens a blind to reveal that Luk\\'s mother is hanging from ropes outside a grated window, still alive. Luk charges at the window, but it\\'s electrified, and he\\'s thrown to the floor, shocked. Using this distraction, Michael leaps forward and attacks Donnie and Madam Leung. Berwick appears and attacks Madam Leung, and Michael focuses on Donnie. Luk gets up and tries to break the electrified window to reach his mother, but the Chinese bodyguard attacks him with skilled kicks. Three simultaneous fights ensue. Donnie kicks Michael down a staircase and pursues him away from the others. The Chinese bodyguard brutally beats the outmatched Luk, reopening his chest wound. Madam Leung and Berwick have an intense back-and-forth fight before she finally kills him with a kick to the throat. The Chinese bodyguard renders Luk all but unconscious and is about to kill him, but Madam Leung intervenes, and a fight begins between her and the bodyguard. She is more than a match for him, and she soon knocks him out. Donnie chases Michael throughout the building, beating him whenever he catches him, until Michael finds a decorative sword and uses it to attack Donnie. Donnie narrowly avoids the blade until Madam Yeung appears with another sword and begins an armed duel with Michael. Donnie climbs to the rooftop to save Luk\\'s mother, but finds her guarded by Woods. They have by far the longest and most spectacular fight in the film as Woods pushes Donnie to his uttermost limits, almost killing him multiple times and finally throwing him to the edge of the roof. Finally Donnie manages to knock Woods off the roof and to his death with a flying kick. Luk rescues his mother. Michael defeats Madam Leung in their sword duel, cutting her and knocking her to the floor, stunned. He\\'s about to kill her, but Luk saves her and manages to disarm Michael. Michael viciously beats Luk, but Luk\\'s mother reloads the gun and saves him with it. Michael disarms her, but Madam Leung recovers and attacks the now unarmed Michael, gaining the advantage. Michael retrieves the tape bomb and its trigger and takes Luk hostage as Madam Leung retrieves the gun. They reach a standoff, but then Madam Leung shoots Michael through the hand, and she and Luk kick him through a glass railing and off a high ledge to his death. In an epilogue, viewers learn that Mr. Robinson was found guilty of drug trafficking and sent to prison.'},\n",

This angers her father Yogi Grewal . The fake husband is a handsome army captain.

She, heartbroken that he left her, sets out for Tara and is saddened when she learns that Mammy, her mainstay since birth, is dying. When she arrives there, she sends a telegram to notify Rhett about Mammy under the name of Will Benteen , because she knows that he won\\'t come if he suspects she is there. Before Mammy passes away she makes him swear to look after \"her lamb\" Miss Scarlett. He agrees, although he has no intention of honoring the request. After she dies, he and Scarlett have another snipe filled encounter, which culminates in him leaving and her returning to the Atlanta house, determined to win him back.  This section is practically identical to that of the book regarding Scarlett\\'s actions at the funeral and Mammy\\'s death bed.  The major differences in Charleston are that of the attitude and demeanors of the characters, but most notably Scarlett and Anne. Scarlett is not shown struggling with her unease in society but rather is criticized when Anne sees her and Ashley go into his hotel room together, resulting in a steamy kiss. Anne is completely different from her counterpart in the novel; while she is supposed to be a clone of Melanie, she shyly, yet coyly, flirts with Rhett and does other things that neither her character in the book nor Melanie never would have done. The series continues to follow the relationship created between them after the book ceases doing so.  Scarlett continues to distance herself from the same character in the novel as her relationship with her kin is not discovering and assimilating her Irish heritage and family, as much as escaping from her grandfather\\'s household and passing the time. Her decision to go to Ireland is also preceded by cutting off all ties to America as well as the details concerning buying her sister Carreen\\'s share of Tara, which had been donated to the convent as a dowry when she became a nun.  Once in Ireland, Scarlett is faced with two main problems, not the source of her struggles in the novel. She is pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, of whom none of her kin approve. She also faces quandaries and mixed feelings regarding physical force the Irish rebels against British rule, highlighted by comparisons of how they are being treated by the English to how the South was treated by the North.  Scarlett keeps her daughter\\'s birth a secret from Rhett to spite him, thinking that if she grows up not knowing him she will not be like Bonnie, and that she will not love him; eventually, he will meet her and realize that she does not love or even know him and Scarlett will have her revenge. Katie is barely talked about outside of this - her role as the possible manifestation of a demon is completely removed. Anne Hampton-Butler also comes to Ireland with Rhett, which never happened in the novel, and even has a lengthy conversation with Scarlett. Her death from yellow fever is also detailed.  Lord Fenton is much more evil than his role in the novel. He forces a servant girl to have sex with him, and rapes Scarlett as well. The servant girl kills him when he does this, but Scarlett is blamed. This is where the plot completely veers from the one in the novel; she is put on trial and Rhett comes to her aid, finding out about Katie. It is also learned that Colum was killed by Lord Fenton for trying to get him to support the servant girl because she was pregnant with his child. She is very reluctant to confess, but after Scarlett is found guilty of murder, she does. Rhett and Scarlett decide to travel the world with Katie.'},\n",

After having found a dinosaur\\'s egg in a cave, White celebrates the discovery, with Azbek, uncorking a bottle of champagne and listening to classical music. Azbek is attacked and killed by Dimorphodons, which also attack White who falls from the plateau holding onto a rope; he survives but is seriously wounded, White is found again and taken care of by Myar and Djena , respectively Azbek\\'s brother and sister; White asks the two to bring him his friend George Challenger  to whom White gives an account of his adventures, proposing to Challenger that he should try to fully explore the plateau in his place. Challenger returns to London, and organizes a lecture to try to convince some people to finance an expedition to prove that dinosaurs still exist despite scientific belief to the contrary. During the lecture, Challenger is derided and humiliated, not only from the students but also from his colleagues Leo Summerlee  and Lord Thomas . However, Lord Thomas ultimately grants permission for the expedition, on the condition that Summerlee accompany Challenger to act as \"a critical eye\". Subsequently, a spectator at the lecture, Oscar Perreault , proposes to pay the expedition\\'s expenses to Mongolia, on the condition that the scientists capture a living dinosaur and to exhibit it to the public wherever he wishes; and that his associate John Roxton David Nerman goes along to represent his interests. Challenger unwillingly accepts the proposal. After concluding the lecture, Challenger bumps into the young journalist Arthur Malone, who he suggests joins the expedition as a documentor. After granting permission to Malone, Challenger is confronted by the same woman who had interrupted his lecture earlier- who reveals herself to be none other than the late Dr. White\\'s daughter, Amanda, who also insists on joining the team in order to represent her father\\'s interests. In the following days, the team heads to Mongolia, stopping on the journey to pick up their guides, including the young siblings Myar and Djena; as the journey goes on, Djena becomes very attached to Malone and strong connection is built between the two. Their transportation suffers a breakdown and the team is forced to continue the trip on foot. One of the guides is killed by what is presumably a prehistoric insect, however, despite misgivings on the part of the guides, the team continues on after conducting a funeral, according to the local rites. The team finally reaches the foot of the plateau where Amanda White is abducted by two natives. Upon noticing Amanda\\'s disappearance the team immediately goes in search of her. Challenger and Roxton quickly find her suspended from a ritual framework by her abductors. In rescuing her, they are also forced to face the native tribe - who are only defeated by use of modern weaponry. The team escapes the charging natives by use of a hot air balloon, in which they fly up the plateau. Using binoculars Summerlee observes three Quetzalcoatlus nearby; the animals prove to be hostile and immediately attack the balloon, knocking the young Myar from it and then causing an irreparable tear to the balloon itself, causing the whole team to plummet to the plateau below. Upon arriving the team is amazed to see a Brontosaurus. After a search the team find shelter in a cave, where they discover a series of intricate symbols on the walls. Roxton decides to return to the wreckage of the balloon to recover his supplies. Upon his return he presents the team with a small Centrosaurus which he wants to sell for $100,000. Roxton the reveals to the team that he intends to make the plateau an area exclusively for high-risk game hunting, and has planned to do so all along. Roxton then orders Malone to tie Djena and Challenger to tie Malone. Taking advantage of Roxton\\'s temporary distraction, Challenger succeeds in disarming Roxton instead and recovers the rifle. However, Roxton aims a knife Djena\\'s neck, forcing Challenger to return the rifle to him. Djena once again distracts Roxton by biting Roxton\\'s hand and Challenger attacks him; ultimately Challenger is able to render Roxton unconscious. Meanwhile, Amanda White and Professor Summerlee are busy trying to decipher the symbols on the cave walls. They are attacked by a dinosaur but are able to fight it off. At the same time, Challenger, Malone and Djena are returning with the tied-up Roxton, and are attacked by a giant crocodile. The crock manages to snap only Roxton, leaving the other three mostly unscathed. Returning to the cave, Amanda White tells the Mongolia\\'s lost world history through the symbols; these tell of a tribe, the kerraks, that have adapted to the place, some dinosaurs were chased by the kerraks, some of which were extinguished and, for this, the native precedents, the neanderthals, chased the kerraks to avoid the total destruction of the lost world, becoming the plateau\\'s custodians. After the story, Professor Summerlee reveals to the team that he doesn\\'t want to return to London, deciding to pass the rest of his life in studying the plateau\\'s environment. Shortly after this a neanderthal appears in the cave, and shoots Summerlee with a blow-gun. The dart causes Summerlee to become very disoriented and experience hallucinations. Under its influence he wanders from the cave and is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The rest of the team finds the dead body of Summerlee, which they cover with a British flag; subsequently. Returning to the cave, Amanda White and Challenger discover that there is, in fact, a larger cave behind the first, the same one discovered by Maple White in the film\\'s first scenes. Exploring the cave the two come across the skeleton of the unlucky Azbek and White\\'s vinyal record. In the same instant, a battered John Roxton, reveals to Amanda White and to Challenger that the cave is full of explosive and that the two cannot be not be saved once he lights the fuse. Roxton is also in possession of a Dimorphodon, which frees itself and attacks him, causing him to fall from the plateau. Before falling however, Roxton manages to light the fuse and Amanda and Challenger barely succeed in escaping. While trying to prepare a parachute, Djena finds a dead velociraptor and is attacked by small eoraptors, which then attack the other team members. Later that night, a Tyrannosaurus attacks the camp; the team tries to escape, but Djena is once again attacked by the small eoraptors, when they disperse Djena is attacked and killed by the T-Rex. Wanting to avenge Djena, Malone distracts the T-Rex by throwing rocks at it . He is ultimately able to kill the T-Rex with a large blast of fire by igniting flammable gas caused by a nearby volcano. Amanda White and Challenger are saved from the hot flash by throwing themselves down from the plateau\\'s frame with the parachute that Deja had been preparing earlier. Returning to London, Challenger communicates the death of his companions to the students. On account of the dangerousness of the place, he chooses to state that the expedition found nothing, thus making sure that no one else goes looking for the plateau.

Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives instructions from the Air Force. Corporal Barnes covers the ice block with a blanket, not realizing it is a warm electric blanket; as the ice melts the creature revives, and finally escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm. The creature is attacked by sled dogs and the scientists recover a severed arm. As the arm warms up, it ingests some of the dead dogs\\' blood covering it, and the hand begins moving. Seed pods are discovered in its palm, demonstrating that the creature is a form of plant life. Carrington is convinced that the creature can be reasoned with and has much to teach them, but Dr. Chapman and the others disagree; the Air Force personnel believe the alien may be dangerous. Carrington deduces their visitor requires blood to survive and reproduce. He later discovers the body of a dead sled dog in the base\\'s greenhouse; the alien has forced the lock on the greenhouse\\'s door and bent it back in shape. Carrington has Dr. Voorhees, Dr. Olsen and Dr. Auerbach, stand guard overnight, waiting for it to return.

Nikki Nicholson, Carrington\\'s secretary, reluctantly updates Hendry when he asks about missing plasma and confronts Carrington in his lab, where he discovers the seeds have grown at an alarming rate. Dr. Wilson advises Carrington that he has not slept, but Carrington remains unconcerned. Hendry then rushes to the greenhouse after hearing what happened there: the alien visitor is behind the door as Hendry opens it, and he immediately slams the door on the creature\\'s regrown arm as it tries to grab him; as the alien pulls its arm back through, its barbed knuckles rip the door\\'s trim to splinters. The alien escapes through the greenhouse\\'s exterior door and breaks into another building in the compound. Following Nicholson\\'s suggestion, Hendry and his men set a trap in a nearby room: they set the creature ablaze using a flare gun and buckets of kerosene, forcing it to jump through a window into the storm. Nicholson notices that the temperature inside the station is falling; a heating fuel line has been sabotaged by the alien. The cold forces everyone to make a final stand near the generator room. They rig an electrical \"fly trap\", hoping to electrocute the creature. As it advances, Carrington tries to save it by shutting off the power and reasoning with it; the alien throws him aside and continues advancing. An airman throws a pick axe at the creature, forcing it to step on their electrical grid; a switch is thrown and the alien is reduced to ash. Hendry orders all traces of the alien visitor destroyed.

              "  'plot': 'Judge Hardin  is an idealistic Los Angeles jurist who gets frustrated when the technicalities of the law prevent the prosecution of two men who are accused of raping and killing a 10-year-old boy. They were driving slowly late at night and attracted the suspicion of two police officers, who wondered if the van\\'s occupants might be burglars. After checking the license plate for violations, the policemen pulled them over for expired paperwork, claimed to have smelled marijuana, then saw a bloody shoe inside the van. However, the paperwork was actually submitted on time , meaning the police had no reason to pull over the van and Hardin has no choice  but to throw out any subsequently discovered evidence, i.e. the bloody shoe. Hardin is even more distraught when the father of the boy attempts to shoot the criminals in court but misses and shoots a cop instead. Subsequently, the father commits suicide while in jail only after he informs Hardin that another boy has been discovered raped and murdered and tells him \"This one is on you, your Honor. That boy would be alive if you hadn\\'t let those men go.\" After hearing all this, Judge Hardin approaches his friend, Judge Caulfield , who tells him of a modern-day Star Chamber: a group of judges who identify criminals who fell through the judicial system\\'s cracks and then take actions against them outside the legal structure. Judge Hardin participates in one of these proceedings in which he presents the case of the two criminals. The Star Chamber declares them \"guilty\" and dispatches a hired assassin. Soon afterward, however, a police detective  comes to Judge Hardin with conclusive evidence that someone else raped and killed the boy. Realizing that he and the Star Chamber have just sentenced two men to die for a crime they didn\\'t commit, Hardin implores the Star Chamber to recall the assassin, but is told by the other judges that the hit cannot be canceled. For the judges\\' own protection, their system includes a buffer between themselves and the assassin; they don\\'t know who he is and he doesn\\'t know who they are. They rationalize to Hardin that although an occasional mistake is inevitable and regrettable, what they are doing still serves society\\'s greater good &mdash; especially, they argue, considering that the two targeted men are clearly criminals guilty of plenty of other crimes, even if not of the specific crime for which the group convicted them. Hardin makes it clear that he does not accept their reasoning. Caulfield warns him to back down because the group will do whatever they have to in order to protect themselves. Hardin refuses to heed this warning and says he will do whatever he can to stop the men from being killed. He then tracks down the men in an attempt to warn them. However, when he arrives, they do not trust him, as he has stumbled across their illegal drug operation. After they attack him, Hardin is saved by the hitman, disguised as a police officer, who kills the two men before they can kill Hardin. The hitman points his gun at Hardin, but at the last moment, the detective arrives and kills the hitman. The movie ends with the Star Chamber deciding another \"case\" without Hardin, who is outside in a car with the detective recording their conversation.'},\n",

Their grandmother, called Gam Gam , gives them two tickets to Munich, where a Mr. Schniedelwichsen  will take them to the family resting place. While waiting for Schniedelwichsen after their arrival, the brothers unintentionally start a brawl that takes down an entire Oktoberfest tent. Schniedelwichsen leads Jan and Todd to Beerfest, an underground drinking game tournament run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen . The triumphant German national team is furious that Schniedelwichsen would bring outsiders to the contest, so he is shot. Jan and Todd discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team reveals that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for \"the greatest beer in all ze world\" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother, Gam Gam. The Germans celebrate an easy win over Jan and Todd in a drinking contest and urge the audience to pelt Jan and Todd with vegetables, destroying the urn containing their grandfather\\'s ashes and spilling them all over the brothers. Swearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to Colorado, where they recruit college drinking friends for an American Beerfest team: *Phil \"Landfill\" Krundle ([[Kevin Heffernan , an overweight former brewery employee and competitive eater; *Charlie \"Fink\" Finklestein , a nerdy Jewish scientist with extensive knowledge of beer and chemistry *Barry Badrinath , an amazingly frequent winner of drinking games but currently a homeless male prostitute. During the team\\'s year of drinking training, Jan and Todd find out their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe. Before the Baron Wolfhausen of the time died, he hid the recipe in a doll he gave the boy Johann before Gam Gam took him to the U.S. Since he was the Baron\\'s first-born child, Johann was the rightful heir to the family brewery in Bavaria. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer for the first time in over a generation. It is easily the best beer they have ever tasted . After the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to confront their Wolfhouse cousins and snatch the recipe using various tactics. Disguised as a nurse for Gam Gam, a spy named Cherry   presumably steals the recipe. When Landfill discovers her true identity, Cherry makes him fall into a beer vat, where he dies trying to drink his way out. The team decides to disband, but suddenly, Landfill\\'s very talented twin brother, Gil , shows up and asks to join the team and be called \"Landfill\" as tribute to his brother. In Germany, Jan and Todd have forgotten where Beerfest is held. Getting Todd drunk, though, jogs his memory through what is referred to as \"Drunken Recall\". The team uses an empty wooden keg as a Trojan Horse to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals , Cherry tells Gil at a crucial moment how his brother Phil died, causing Gil to crack and the Germans to win. Jan, still unaware that Cherry stole the recipe, offers the Germans a double or nothing chance. If the Germans win, they get the recipe; if the Americans win, they get the Bavarian brewery. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out the stolen recipe is the wrong one, which prompts Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink\\'s yarmulke, he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage  which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team\\'s anchor fails to finish \"Das Boot\" . A single drop falls from it, disqualifying the German team. The team celebrates in Amsterdam, where they bump into Willie Nelson . Because Willie\\'s marijuana-smoking tournament teammates, Cheech and Chong, were not able to attend the contest, Nelson invites the Beerfest team to join him and they gladly do so. The film ends with a smoke-filled screen and the words \"Coming Soon - Potfest\".'},\n",

Into the police office walks Min Soo-Ah . She used to be a promising cadet at the police academy, but after a horrific car accident which killed her surrogate brother, Soo-Ah\\'s police career ended. Min Soo-Ah also lost her eyesight in the car accident. Min Soo-Ah reveals to Detective Jo  at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-Ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn\\'t take Soo-Ah\\'s claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-Ah displays her acute senses the detective starts to believe her. Detective Jo and Min Soo-Ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward Kwon Ki-Sub . Kwon Ki-Sub is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witness the hit and run incident. Kwon Ki-Sub also emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan. Meanwhile, Min Soo-Ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man. [Spoiler] It turns out that the gynecologist, Myung Jin  is the mysterious man stalking her as well as the killer. Min Soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent/cologne, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. While in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. The body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and Myung Jin gets out to examine it. When Min Soo-Ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. He leaves her in the rain when another car comes. The reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in. She had gotten angry and stormed out because her ex-guardian tried to give her two things-- tickets to her dead brother\\'s dance group\\'s upcoming dance showdown, and a device that vibrates when a person or moving object-- or any object-- came too close. It would help her with her disability, but Min Soo-ah strongly disapproved of it. One night when Ki-Sub is walking home alone, he is followed by Myung Jin. Ki-Sub at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. An ambulance comes and the Detective/Min Soo-ah drives to the scene. When the Detective finishes up his interviews with the people and follows the ambulance to the hospital, we realize that Myung Jin was in the background, watching Min Soo-Ah in the car. At the hospital, the doctor tells them that because Ki-Sub has such a thick skull, only a small fracture was shown in the X-Ray scan. They are relieved and visits him. Ki-Sub gets annoyed by Min Soo-ah\\'s constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. When he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees Min Soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway, as well as the killer. He calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. As he runs to catch up with her, she goes on Facetime and shows him her location and surroundings. He guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her seeing-dog, Seul-Gi . However, at one point, she trips, but gets up and feels the ground and way out . However, at one point, the killer catches up with her and leads her away, with a knife to her body. She reaches into her handbag and sprays his eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with Seul-Gi. When she reaches the elevator, she thought that she\\'d be safe, but the killer quickly gets in. Ki-Sub, who still sees her surroundings by Facetime, gets scared when he sees blood splatter on the elevator\\'s button and the fact that Min Soo-Ah fainted. However, what they didn\\'t know at the time was that Seul-Gi shielded Min Soo-Ah from the knife and while she was getting stabbed, grabbed the killer by the jacket and led him out of the elevator. In that scene, Seul-Gi dies by being stabbed many times while watching her owner go up through the elevator. When Min Soo-Ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but the doctor handed her the blood-stained leash. At home, Min Soo-Ah listens to many video tapes of her past self, when she had just graduated from the police academy. She laid down and listened to her brother\\'s voice, as well as the voice of the orphanage lady. Halfway through, she gets a call from an unknown number. There is a raspy voice. The caller warns her from this case. \"You can\\'t see me, but I\\'m watching you.\" A few days later, the Detective had narrowed down the number of licensed imported black Sedans and finally, in a garage, he finds the killer. They get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. Meanwhile, Ki-Sub and Min Soo-Ah visits the orphanage again when they\\'re asked to watch over it while the grandmother takes the children out. Ki-Sub finds the dead brother\\'s room and various pictures. Min Soo-Ah goes to the \\'office\\' and finds a cabinet filled with her past memories as a cop, as well as the vibrating motion sensor. The killer enters into the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. Min Soo-Ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. She reprimands Ki-Sub for playing it, but smells the cigarette. Ki-Sub goes upstairs and fights with Myung Jin while Min Soo-Ah runs away. After a few minutes of them playing Cat and Mouse, she lights him on fire and takes the vibrating motion sensor. She helps Ki-Sub outside, where it\\'s raining. Ki-Sub fights the killer again and Min Soo-Ah goes to the car and breaks it with the motion sensor. The killer runs at her with a knife and with the right timing and the motion sensor, she hits him on the head, making him fall unconsious. The police, who had picked up the Detective\\'s body, had found the evidence and eventually found out who the killer was. The killer was put in jail and Min Soo-Ah was re-admitted to the academy and graduated again. Ki-Sub also enrolled into the police academy. It ends with another video, similar to the video of her first graduation, except instead of her surrogate brother, it had Ki-Sub.

He takes them up to an unfamiliar area of the woods where there is a massive plantation, at least fifty plants. Steve and Bob start to steal a couple because they figured that no one would notice. At this time, Peter notices a sleeping bag on the ground just seconds before someone fires a shotgun at them. As they run away, Peter stops and looks back and sees that the person chasing them is Max. It\\'s revealed that this is his secret garden. Max is angry and feels betrayed that he caught Peter stealing his plants and he yells at him to leave. When Peter gets back to Jack\\'s, Jack confronts him and asks him how many plants Max has. At first, he is hesitant to answer, so Jack takes him out on a nature walk and explains to him the dangers of having more than a few plants. He believes that by growing only twenty plants, he makes enough to get by and keeps from attracting the fed\\'s attention. He warns Peter against letting greed run his life, because doing so destroys the entire reason they came out to the lost coast in the first place. After this, he goes to Max\\'s house and asks him why he didn\\'t tell him about the other plants. It\\'s at this time that a federal police cruiser comes by and arrests Peter and Max. Peter is interrogated, but he reveals nothing and they are let go. Afterwards Peter starts to question why he is still there. The next day, Jack has a BBQ. He confronts Max about his secret crop. Without answering his question, Max instead mocks Jack, saying that the feds are probably there for all of the research that Jack has been doing all of these years. Jack angrily storms off and Rosie reveals to Peter that Jack isn\\'t Max\\'s father. Jack, Rosie and her then-husband, Charlie were all friends when they worked as professors at UCLA and they decided to move to Humboldt County together. However, eventually Charlie, who had been a long time alcoholic and drinking buddy of Jack\\'s, died in a car accident while suffering from an episode of extreme alcohol withdrawal. Peter decides that he can\\'t be a part of Max\\'s operation any more and he tries to leave. Max gets angry and tells him that this isn\\'t a game and he can\\'t back out, but Peter starts walking away anyway. Max then starts to cry and tells Peter that if he doesn\\'t pull this off, Charity will end up just like him. While this affects Peter greatly, he still continues to walk off. Charity then finds Peter crying by a tree and asks him what\\'s wrong. He asks her what she wants to be when she grows up and she says an astronaut. When she asks him what he wants to be, he says that he no longer knows, and she says that that\\'s all right, which comforts Peter. The next day, Peter\\'s father shows up at the house, using Star-69 and MapQuest he managed to find where Peter was. After a brief visit with Jack and Rosie, where he is greatly put off to find that this is where his son has been all this time, he tells Peter that they\\'re leaving, and Peter reluctantly goes with him despite his new-found bond with Jack and Rosie. As they\\'re driving, his father tells Peter that he decided to pass him, but this news doesn\\'t affect Peter much. He then sees Bob and Steve speeding down the road in the opposite direction, followed by Max and then by a federal helicopter. Peter realizes that they must have found Max\\'s secret crop and are on their way to raid it. He gets out of the car and tells his father to head for the beach  and he runs off to stop Max from trying to save his crop. Peter\\'s father gets to the beach, where he finds Jack along with all of the other local pot farmers. He informs him that Peter took off. Jack hadn\\'t seen Max anywhere and he connected the dots and headed off towards Max\\'s crop. When Peter gets there, he finds Max trying to save as many of his plants before the DEA gets there and Peter begins to help. Then the feds show up and Peter and Max narrowly manage to hide themselves. Then Jack shows up and leads them both back to the beach, where Charity happily reunites with Max. Peter says that he\\'s sorry to Max for his loss and Max tells him not to take it so seriously. That night, Max is at the bar drowning his sorrows when his drunken behavior gets him kicked out. He is then seen driving down the highway and laughing to himself. The scene then cuts to the next day when a sheriff shows up at Jack and Rosie\\'s and informs them that Max is dead. They then call Peter, who is staying at a hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and afterwards finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt, he says that it was his idea to come up there and he blames himself for the death of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left, but Peter then tells him that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the event horizon . The ending is left up to the viewer for interpretation. It shows Peter and his father having breakfast at a diner before leaving back for Los Angeles. A bus then pulls up outside as one of the passengers needs to use the bathroom. Peter then gets up – his father apparently assuming he is going to the bathroom – and heads outside and gets on the bus, which then leaves when the other passenger gets back.'},\n",

Also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theatre troupe are Josephine Marcus  and Mr. Fabian . The married Wyatt attempts to resist a strong attraction to Josephine. Wyatt\\'s wife, Mattie Blaylock , is becoming dependent on laudanum. Just as Wyatt and his brothers begin to benefit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon, they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys.

Conflict is narrowly avoided upon Wyatt\\'s insistence that he is retired and no longer interested in a career enforcing the law. This is also the first face-to-face meeting for Holliday and Johnny Ringo , who take an immediate dislike to one another. As tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys. Shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house, Curly Bill is ordered by Marshal White  to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill shoots the marshal and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton  and the other Cowboys, who threaten Wyatt, his brothers, and Doc. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary gunfight at the O.K.

At Hooker\\'s ranch, they encounter Josephine, learning that Mr. Fabian was shot by Cowboys who tried to steal Josephine\\'s watch. Wyatt finally realizes he wants to be with Josephine, but is unable to commit to her because of his ongoing fight against the Cowboys.

              "  'plot': 'On a sunny early autumn day in an affluent suburb in Connecticut, Ned Merrill , a seemingly successful, appealing and popular middle-aged advertising executive, clad only in swimming trunks, runs through the forest. He walks out of the woods and into the backyard of some old friends sitting by their swimming pool. He chats with them, then he has a sudden idea: he tells his friends he intends to \"swim\" home across the county by dropping in on friends\\' swimming pools which form a consecutive chain leading back to his house. He dives into the pool, emerges at the other end and starts his journey. At first Ned gets warm welcomes as he meets old friends, mostly upper middle-class, well-to-do people with homes in the upscale outer suburbs. However, there are hints that Ned has been away for up to two years, and he brushes off any questions about himself. Each stop brings him face to face with some aspect of his life. The first one is with his youth when anything was possible, while the last one exposes the current collapse of his family life and where everything seems lost. As the day wears on and Ned sees those who have been closer to him more recently, the welcomes begin to sour. Ned\\'s proud boasts about his wife, daughters and home are met with strong mixed feelings, jeers, suspicion and even anger - especially from women. In one backyard Ned meets a 20-year-old girl  who, years ago, had babysat his daughters. She leaves with him, at first thrilled to do so owing to an unspoken crush she had for him in her early teens. But when Ned rather clumsily tries to woo and kiss her, she flees. He carries on with his \"swim,\" dropping by the pools of sundry other friends as it slowly unfolds that his life has somehow gone quite wrong. He crashes a party at one pool. While he is put up with at first, Ned is thrown out when he has an outburst after spotting a hot dog wagon he had once bought for his daughters, but which had recently been sold in a white elephant sale. He then shows up at the backyard pool of Shirley Abbott , a stage actress with whom he\\'d had an affair several years earlier. She is still feeling bitter and hurt. When Ned tries to rekindle things, this poolside meeting ends badly for both of them. As the day ends, Ned winds up in a crowded public swimming pool where he is shamed by local shopkeepers to whom he still owes money for unpaid grocery and restaurant tabs. When some of them comment about his wife\\'s overall snobbish attitude and his out-of-control daughters\\' recent troubles with the law, he angrily flees. As the sun goes down, a shivering Ned at last staggers up a rocky hill, shoves open a rusted gate and walks through an overgrown garden with an unkempt tennis court. A thunderstorm begins as Ned knocks on the front door of a locked, dark and empty house. He then breaks down on the front stoop and cries.'},\n",

Giovanni\\'s new book, La stagione , has just been published and Tommaso praises his friend\\'s work. They drink champagne together, but Tommaso is unable to hide his severe pain. Shaken by the sight of her dying friend, Lidia leaves, saying she\\'ll visit again tomorrow. Giovanni stays behind a while longer. As he leaves his friend\\'s room, a sick and uninhibited young woman attempts to seduce Giovanni before being interrupted by the nurses. Outside the hospital Giovanni sees his wife crying but does not comfort her. As they drive off he tells her about his \"unpleasant\" encounter with the sick woman, and is surprised when Lidia dismisses the incident. They drive to a party celebrating Giovanni\\'s new book, which has been well received. Giovanni signs books while his wife looks on from a distance. After awhile Lidia leaves, still shaken by Tommaso\\'s dire condition. She wanders the streets of Milan, ending up in the neighborhood where she and Giovanni lived as newlyweds. She comes across a brutal street fight which she tries to stop, and later she watches rockets being set off in a field. Back at the apartment Giovanni finally hears from Lidia and he picks her up from the old neighborhood which seems to have little sentimental value for him. Later they decide to go to a nightclub where they watch a mesmerising and seductive performance by a female dancer, and engage in small talk. \"I no longer have inspirations, only recollections,\" Giovanni tells his wife. Lidia suggests that they leave the club and attend a swanky party thrown by a millionaire businessman. \"One must do something,\" she says. At the party, Giovanni socialises with the guests and appears to be in his element, while Lidia walks around in a state of boredom. They spend some time with the host, Mr. Gherardini , who seems disappointed by his wealth. They exchange insincere flattery. Giovanni wanders off and meets Valentina Gherardini , the lively, charming daughter of the host. As they flirt, she teaches him a game she just invented involving sliding a compact across the floor, and soon others gather to watch their competition. Later they see each alone and Giovanni makes a pass at her, kissing her while Lidia looks on from the floor above. Later Mr. Gherardini meets privately with Giovanni and offers him an executive position with his company to write the history of his company. Giovanni is reluctant to accept, but leaves the offer open. With Lidia\\'s family\\'s wealth and his own earnings from publishing, he doesn\\'t need the money. Meanwhile Lidia calls the hospital and learns that their friend Tommaso died ten minutes earlier. Overwelmed with grief, she watches from a window the guests enjoying themselves. Later she sits at a table alone opposite an empty chair. Giovanni walks over and does not sit down, and Lidia does not tell him about Tommaso\\'s death. Giovanni sees Valentina and follows after her, leaving Lidia alone. Lidia walks to the band and appears to enjoy the music. A man named Roberto  who had been following her approaches and asks her to dance, and she accepts. A sudden rain shower, however, sends the guests running for cover, with some jumping in the pool like children. As Lidia is about to jump in from the diving board, Roberto stops her, takes her to his car, and they drive off together. She enjoys Roberto\\'s company and their conversation, but as he\\'s about to kiss her, Lidia turns away from him, saying, \"I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t.\" Back at the party Giovanni searches through the crowd and finds Valentina alone watching the rain. She tells him she\\'s smart enough not to break up a marriage, and instructs him to spend the rest of the evening with his wife. Giovanni reveals that he\\'s going through a \"crisis\" common among writers, but in his case it is affecting his whole life. They return to the guests, just as Lidia and Roberto return from their drive. Giovanni seems slightly annoyed by Lidia\\'s behavior. Valentina invites Lidia to dry off in her room, where Lidia confronts her directly about her husband. As the women chat, Giovanni overhears his wife tell Valentina that she feels like dying and putting an end to the agony of her life. Noticing Giovanni she tells him that she is not a bit jealous of his playing around with Valentina. They say goodbye to Valentina and leave the party at morning\\'s first light with the jazz band still playing for the few couples still listening. As Giovanni and Lidia walk away across Gherardini\\'s private golf course, they talk about the job offer that Giovanni says he\\'ll turn down. Lidia finally tells him about Tommaso\\'s death, and recounts how Tommaso used to support her and offer his affections to her, but she eventually chose Giovanni because she loved him. She tells him, \"I feel like dying because I no longer love you.\" Giovanni recognizes the failure of their marriage, but tells her, \"Let\\'s try to hold onto something we\\'re sure of. I love you. I\\'m sure I\\'m still in love with you.\" Lidia takes out a love letter Giovanni wrote to her just before they were married and reads it aloud. Giovanni asks who wrote it, and she says, \"You did.\" Giovanni embraces and kisses her, but she resists saying she no longer loves him, and neither does he love her. Unable to acknowledge his own failure, Giovanni continues to make love to her in a sandtrap on a golf course beneath a gray morning sky.'},\n",

While searching for him, she encounters Lila Littlewolf , a Mohawk bingo-parlor employee who is driving his car, which she claims she found abandoned with the keys in the ignition at the local bus-station. The two women, who have fallen on hard economic times, form a desperate and uneasy alliance and begin trafficking illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States across the frozen St. Lawrence River for $1200 each per crossing. Ray's older son T.J.  wants to find a job and help support the family so they can afford to eat something more substantial than popcorn and Tang. He and his mother clash over whether he should remain in high-school and look after his little brother Ricky or drop out to work. To make matters worse, T.J. sets an outside corner of the trailer afire with a torch in an attempt to unfreeze the water pipe. Lila longs for the day she will be able to reclaim and live with her young son, who was taken from her by her mother-in-law immediately after his birth.

After a family member receives a Nagavalli portrait as a prize in the Nagavalli Dance competition, various characters start having abnormal experiences. In order to save themselves and unfold the mystery, the family looks to Ramachandra Siddhanthi and Dr. Vijay. The story starts off with an ancient painting of Chandramukhi alias Nagavalli , distributed as a prize to bharathanatyam dancer Gayathri , her husband and her family. Gayathri lives in a palatial house in Tirupathi with her husband, father Shankar Rao , mother Parvathi , sisters Geetha  and Gowri , maternal uncle Appa Rao, his wife and maternal cousins Pooja and Hema happily. Few years later, Gayathri and her Husband are shown to be dead. However, at the Engagement day of Gowri,youngest of the three sisters of Gayathri,one of her friends had fainted by encountering a huge thirty-feet Snake/Serpent, and the bridegroom/fiancé had ran away from the family house fearing of something. All strange incidents happen as the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer had died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The members of the family are psychologically affected by the presence of Chandramukhi's painting and things have not been going well in the house. They decided to contact Acharya Ramchandra Siddhanthi , an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters had told the people and the Acharya that Gayathri and her husband died suddenly after the bharathanatyam competition. The Acharya takes the help of Dr Vijay , a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Chandramukhi, and is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. So the father had warned everyone to not go to the outhouse or to the room where Chandramukhi's painting is. At first both Achrya and Dr. Vijay suspects Geetha due to her strange behaviour. One night, Dr. Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and there was another smaller portrait of Chandramukhi in the outhouse and the Doctor wondered how this portrait of Chandramukhi had come here, and it was revealed that Gayathri is still alive, but became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Chandramukhi, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Gayathri was mad and so Geetha vowed that she wouldn't marry, and since they didn't want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied saying Gayathri was dead. In a few occasions, someone attempted to murder the Acharya twice. Suspecting Gayathri, the acharya asks the family members to bring Gayathri to the temple and that he will show everyone that Chanramukhi is in Gayathri's body, but as Gayathri stepped the temple, all animals were running out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Dr. Vijay starts to investigate everything so he goes to the library to read a book based on Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara 's life and further information on Nagavalli too. The investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara  used to live and how his enmity with Chandramukhi has been going on since centuries, and was revealed that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Dominion and the people to go and slaughter and assassinate him... but the book didn't tell if he got assassinated, or if he really committed suicide or if he is alive. Dr. Vijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him: Chandramukhi... and he understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Chandramukhi, Dr. Vijay goes to Chandramukhi's place and an old man told the Doctor that Chandramukhi's family died back at around a hundred years and told him that he was the second person to enquire about Chandramukhi's family, and as the Doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Chandramukhi, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Chandramukhi's place, she was holding a portrait of Chandramukhi and ran away like a mad girl, so the Doctor goes to Chandramukhi's house and realizes and understands that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Chandramukhi which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Dr. Vijay also investigates about Gayathri's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Gayathri's husband's death had nothing to do with Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay reveals that Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile of his and when the Acharya told Dr. Vijay that this person can still be alive. So Dr. Vijay goes to the Fort/Cage where the crumpled Raja is, and at the time, the Acharya performs a pooja to try to bring Chandramukhi out of Gayathri's body. The Doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when the Acharya asks for Gayathri's name, she says her name as Chandramukhi Gayathri, but is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay comes back to cure Gayathri from her madness, and he succeeds, but the problem of Chandramukhi is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later the Doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Chandramukhi as he makes her angry and change personality from Gowri to Chandramukhi in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to her normal position. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Chandramukhi in Tamil when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the Engagement day and sat downstairs like as if she didn't know anything. In order to know more about Chandramukhi's lover Gunashekharan, she went to Chandramukhi's house as Gowri, and returned with Chandramukhi's photo, completely as Chandramukhi. Afterwards Gowri goes to the cage/fort where Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is, to kill him. Dr. Vijay, knowing Gowri would have definitely seek revenge goes to the cage/fort where the Raja almost gets burnt to death, but he survives when it starts to rain, then Dr. Vijay has a battle with him, and the Raja almosts decapitates Gowri/Chandramukhi, but before he does so, the Doctor finishes off the Crumpled Raja, and it is the end of Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara's story. Gowri is no more affected by Chandramukhi anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too and it all comes to a happy ending.\"},\n",

Ali & the teenager were orphaned brothers, while Inder was Ali's friend. An old man named Rahim Chacha was their guardian. The mysterious girl Ali saw was Mehak, his love. Ali & Inder had won medals for shooting during many contests, although Ali was always the best. The marksmanship skills of Ali & Inder are seen by an Inspector, who makes a proposal to them: masquerade as goons of a gang, kill goons of their rival gang & trick both the gangs to destroy each other in gang wars. Ali refuses flatly, but after some goons kill Rahim Chacha, Ali & Inder decide to take the offer. Mehak gives both the guys portable video recorders, so that they can prove their innocence if anything goes wrong. Soon, the Inspector takes them to the Chief Minister & his aide. They plan to enact an attack on the CM, making the opposition look dirty in eyes of people & garnering sympathy votes for CM. However, when Ali is trying to fake the shooting, somebody really kills the CM. The police start chasing Ali thinking him to be the killer & Ali flees. After recovering his memory, Ali realizes that the CM's aide took advantage of the plan to become CM himself. Meanwhile, Ali learns that Inder made Mehak his fiancee to save her from harassment. Ali tries to tell the truth to the Inspector, but realizes that nobody believes him. In an attack when Ali goes aboard a local, the remaining memories come to him. He remembers boarding the train same way on the day of assassination where Inder met him & confessed to killing the CM. Thereafter, Inder shot Ali to hide the truth & threw his body in a river. Suddenly, the Inspector confronts him, but Ali convinces the Inspector by telling the truth. Ali goes to Mehak & tells her everything. He realizes that there must be some incriminating evidence in Inder's tapes. As he plays a tape, Mehak witnesses in horror Inder striking the deal with CM's aide. Ali notifies Inder that he remembers everything now. Inder, along with his cronies, comes to kill Ali, but Mehak dies in the process. Ali kills the goons & demands Inder an explanation. Inder reveals that he was always second best with Ali around & that even Mehak, whom he secretly loved, chose Ali over him. Also, Ali always got money & fame more easily than Inder. Inder reveals that he had sent the goons to kill Rahim Chacha, thus manipulating Ali to take the offer. Also, when Ali came back to Bombay, Inder saw him. Inder was the sniper whom Ali's brother saw. Ali kills Inder in a hand-to-hand combat. Ali broadcasts Inder's tape over the cable TV network, thus freeing himself from his charges & putting the present CM in the dock. He returns to the village and marries Muskaan, just as planned.\"},\n",

The ninja then escapes and the Titans head to Tokyo, Japan, to search for his master. After overcoming the language barrier  and fighting a giant reptile, the Titans meet Tokyo\\'s own super-normal defence force - the Tokyo Troopers, led by Commander Uehara Daizo. Daizo shows the Titans around the Tokyo Troopers headquarters, and when Robin questions him on Brushogun, he informs the Titans that he is nothing more than an urban legend. Left with no villains to pursue, the Titans can do nothing more than bow to Beast Boy\\'s desire to enjoy Tokyo as tourists. Investigating alone, Robin is attacked once more by Saico-Tek and they get into a very violent fight which ends with Robin pummeling the ninja into the ground. When Saico-Tek does not rise, the crowd watching believes Robin has murdered his opponent. Commander Daizo apprehends Robin, despite the hero\\'s protestations of innocence, but as he is transferred, a slip of paper bearing the name \"Brushogun\" flits into the armoured car carrying him and explodes, freeing him. Now on the run, Robin co-opts the identity of a Shinjuku mugger who tried to shoot him and reunites with the other Titans, who have themselves been attacked by strange creatures. Brushogun, as Raven relates from the book she found, was an artist who had fallen in love with a woman he had drawn and had attempted to bring her to life using Japanese black magic. The spell turned against the artist and he was transformed into a being of paper and ink - ink that he could use to bring any creation he could imagine to life. With this new information, Robin has no trouble deducing Brushogun\\'s hideout: Beast Boy\\'s favorite manga publishing house. Breaking in, the Titans discover the withered form of Brushogun, wired into a printing press that draws on his powers to create the enemies the Titans have faced. The true villain turns out to be Daizo, who has used Brushogun\\'s powers to create both his Tokyo Troopers and the monsters that they captured so that he could earn a reputation as a hero. A massive battle ensues, culminating in Robin facing Daizo. With no options of escape left, Daizo hurls himself from the catwalk, into the ink reservoir of the press, taking control of Brushogun\\'s magic powers and transforming himself into a giant, hulking mass of ink and machinery, with Brushogun at the center. As the other Titans battle creatures Daizo hurls at them, Robin frees Brushogun. As the old man fades away in his arms like ink, his powers disappear and Daizo is left defeated and exposed. After the battle, Robin tries to explain his true and strong romantic feelings for Starfire, but getting the message, she silences him by simply saying, \"Robin, stop talking.\" The two romantically kiss each other as the other three Titans look on, with Cyborg stating, \"Well, it\\'s about time\". A short time later, the Titans are awarded medals of honor by the mayor for their actions, and the inhabitants of Tokyo welcome their new heroes. Robin and Starfire are seen holding hands, implying that they are now a romantic couple. Beast Boy then declares that he wants to go to Mexico next year, prompting Raven to slap him in the back of his head.'},\n",

Once at a dockside warehouse, the frozen Velociraptors escape, who kill many of the terrorists before the police arrive, who expect to find drug smugglers. After finding the sole survivor, the police are killed inside the warehouse by the Velociraptors. An anti-terrorist special force led by Colonel Rance Higgins is called in by General Mercer where they find pieces of bodies and a refrigeration truck rather than uranium. They maneuver through warehouse boxes until two get slashed to death. The survivors learn from Dr. Hodges that these are the last three \"carnosaurs\" in existence: two male Velociraptors and one female T-Rex left from the genetic reconstructions of the previous Carnosaur installments. It is made clear that the dinosaurs need to be caught alive, relating to the potential for curing major diseases. A massive meat shipment resides at the dock, so the three soldiers hunt in that area, meeting up with a unit of Marines who have come as backup. Soldier Polchek is given drugs to shoot into the carnosaurs as the group set up a lure and net trap with meat. One of the carnosaurs attacks and almost succeeds in dragging off Polchek, but is shot down. Hodges soon theorizes that the T-Rex is breeding since Polchek was being dragged off, perhaps to hatchlings. The next plan is to destroy the ship they\\'re on into the Pacific and freeze the dinosaurs somehow. When time comes to explore the lower decks of the ship, the carnosaurs knock out the lights and kill a couple more soldiers. The rest get to an elevator, but a dinosaur chews the cable through and they crash on the bottom level, discovering the nest of eggs which they begin to shoot, causing the T-Rex to become mad, ripping off Polchek\\'s arm. Rance and Proudfoot rejoin Dr. Hodges and Marine Rossi, split up again and rig dynamite. Rossi is eaten by the Rex; Proudfoot\\'s head is ripped off; and the remaining two shoot two of the dinosaurs.

The Bride herself then appears behind the wheel of a car, briefly recounting the events of the previous film and stating she is currently on her way to kill Bill. In a flashback, the Bride — visibly pregnant — and her groom  rehearse their wedding. Bill, her former lover and leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, arrives unexpectedly and wishes her well. It is revealed that the Bride had retired from assassination and left Bill in order to give a better life to her unborn daughter. Moments later, the other assassination squad members arrive and attack the wedding rehearsal on Bill\\'s orders. In the present, Bill warns his brother Budd , a former Deadly Viper and now a bouncer, that he will be targeted next. The Bride arrives at his trailer and bursts through the door, expecting to ambush him, but Budd is expecting her, shooting her in the chest with a double-barreled shotgun blast of rock salt, then sedates her. Budd calls Elle Driver , another former Deadly Viper, offering to sell her the Bride\\'s Hanzō sword for a million dollars cash. He then seals the Bride inside a coffin and buries her alive. A flashback shows Bill and the Bride camping one night, when Bill tells her a story of legendary martial arts master Pai Mei  and his Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a death blow Pai Mei has so far refused to teach any of his students. Bill then takes the Bride to Pai Mei\\'s temple to be trained by him. Though Pai Mei initially ridicules her for being a Caucasian-American woman , she eventually gains his respect and learns a number of techniques, including the art of punching through thick planks of wood from inches away. She uses this skill to break out of the coffin and claws her way to the surface. Elle arrives at Budd\\'s trailer for their transaction but has hidden a lethal black mamba with her money, which kills him. She then calls Bill and tells him that the Bride has killed Budd by putting the black mamba in his trailer, and that Elle has killed the Bride; it is at this point that the Bride\\'s name, Beatrix Kiddo, is finally revealed. As she exits the trailer, she is ambushed by Beatrix, who had arrived there soon after Elle. In the middle of an all-out battle in the trailer, Elle taunts Beatrix with the news that Elle had poisoned Pai Mei in revenge for his snatching out her eye when she called him a \"miserable old fool.\" Beatrix then plucks out Elle\\'s remaining eye and leaves her screaming and thrashing about in the trailer with the black mamba. Beatrix subsequently travels to Mexico to interrogate an elderly gentleman, Esteban Vihaio, about Bill\\'s whereabouts. Esteban, who is the proprietor of a brothel, was purportedly a father figure to a younger Bill. Regardless, Esteban willingly divulges Bill\\'s location, stating that Bill \"would want [him] to.\" After finding Bill deep in the Mexican countryside, Beatrix is shocked to find her now-four-year-old daughter B.B.  alive and well.

Beatrix explains that she ran away without telling Bill in order to protect their unborn daughter from him and his life. Though Bill understands, he remains unapologetic for what he did, explaining that he\\'s \"a murdering bastard,\" and that \"there are consequences for breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.\" They fight, but although Beatrix loses her weapon, she disables Bill with Pai Mei\\'s Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, which he had secretly taught her.

Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, keep refusing to hospitalize him and send him away. Meanwhile, his health deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling and he slowly loses consciousness. The reasons for neglecting him range from the fact that the hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident to the doctors being only humans who are tired, bored, or simply do not feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is the paramedic, who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her.

              "  'plot': 'In 1891, wealthy Sheikh Riyadh  sends his attaché Aziz  to invite American Frank Hopkins , and his mustang, Hidalgo, to enter the \"Ocean of Fire,\" an annual 3,000-mile survival race across the Najd desert region, a race traditionally restricted to pure-bred Arabian horses. Hopkins had been a cowboy and a dispatch rider for the United States government. In this capacity, he had carried a message to the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, authorizing the attack at Wounded Knee that resulted in massacre of a band of Lakota Sioux. While working as a stunt rider in Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West show, Hopkins and his horse are advertised as \"the world\\'s greatest distance horse and rider\". The Arabs consider the al-Khamsa line to be the greatest distance horses. Aziz asks the show to stop using that phrase or to allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to enter the race and prove themselves. The American cowboy and his mustang are placed against the world\\'s greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders, some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner—and especially an \"impure\" horse—from finishing the race. For Hopkins, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor but a race for his survival, as he and his horse attempt the near-impossible desert crossing. He intends to use the purse for saving mustangs. They were important to the Indians, who trained and used them, but the US government was trying to eliminate them to convert the Indians to farming. Throughout the race, competitors try to kill Hopkins and Hidalgo. Chief adversaries include the wealthy, spoiled British aristocrat Lady Anne Davenport , who owns a rival Arabian horse and is used to getting her own way. Another is the Sheikh\\'s nephew, who wishes, contrary to his uncle\\'s decree, to marry his cousin, the sheikh\\'s daughter Jazira . A spirited girl and a horse-rider in her own right, she is rescued by Hopkins from a raid in which the Sheikh\\'s nephew hoped to force her marriage by dishonoring her. She grows to trust the American. A recurring theme in the film is the fact that Hopkins\\' father was European American and his mother a member of the Native American Lakota tribe. The Lakota call him \"Blue Child\" or \"Far Rider\". As a half-breed, he feels sympathy and pity for his mother\\'s people, who are being driven to extinction by the settlers. However, he does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the Wounded Knee massacre, for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing a veil, saying that he mustn\\'t \"go through life hiding what God made you.... like me.\" Near the end of the race, Hidalgo is severely injured and Hopkins is dying of thirst. As he hallucinates, by Lakota tradition he sings a prayer to Wakan Tanka as his death song. But Hidalgo struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to finish the race, which he wins. After Hopkins returns to the United States, he buys many mustangs which would have been killed by the Government in an effort to control Indians. He releases the horses, including Hidalgo, into the wild.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'After the sudden death of their father, four children — teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie — find themselves penniless and forced to travel with their mother Corinne to live with her wealthy parents . Corinne informs her children that there has been tension between herself and her parents for many years, but does not elaborate and simply says they had cut her out of their lives for something she had done that they disapproved of. The children trust her, though Cathy is skeptical at times. Corinne\\'s mother Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes her daughter and her children into her home, though with the harsh condition that the children must be sequestered away in a locked room so that her husband Malcolm  will never know of their existence. To that end, the children are shut up in one bedroom in the mansion, only with access to the mansion\\'s attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that the grandmother reveals the shocking truth: Corinne and her husband were really uncle and niece, making their love incestuous and their children the product of said incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she has been savagely horsewhipped by her mother as a punishment for her incestuous relationship. Corinne admits to the children that she and their father were uncle and niece, and the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corinne tells the children that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, when he dies they will be free. The film focuses on the children\\'s ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their incestuous conception. The children struggle to survive, even as their mother\\'s visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers. Discovering them sleeping in the same bed one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy\\'s ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father, and after she discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but later on Olivia ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off her hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn\\'t die of starvation. As time goes on, the children are often sick, especially the younger ones. Chris and Cathy manage to secretly remove the hinges from their locked door on a few occasions to sneak out of their room, and discover that their mother has been living a life of luxury as well as dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She does eventually come to visit them again, and they confront her about leaving them there to suffer and ignoring them. Corinne is very defensive and acts insulted, cries that they are cruel to think that she is deliberately neglecting them, or enjoying life while they are locked up. She storms out. Shortly after, Cory becomes deathly ill. The children ask Olivia and Corinne to take Cory to the hospital, which they do, but later Corinne returns to inform them Cory has died. The children are devastated, but not long after they start to suspect that Olivia has been poisoning all of them when their pet mouse Fred is found dead after eating part of a cookie. Chris researches and concludes that Cory and Fred were killed via arsenic poisoning, mixed in the sugar on the cookies they are served with the breakfast. The remaining siblings decide to leave the attic once and for all. Chris sneaks out to steal money before they escape and discovers that their mother is planning to wed Bart Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Though upset, he suggests to Cathy they dress up in fancy clothes from the attic, and use the wedding as a cover to sneak out of the house. When Olivia secretly enters their bedroom the next day, hoping to catch them once more doing something \"evil\", Chris takes her by surprise and beats her unconscious with a bedpost. As they are leaving, Cathy decides they should reveal themselves to their grandfather . However, when they enter his room, they find it empty, with the bed dismantled: the grandfather, Malcolm, has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will, which connects the final dots—Malcolm, still suspicious of his daughter, put a clause in his will which states that if it is ever revealed that she had children from her first marriage, she will be disinherited and lose all of her money. They realize that their mother was the one poisoning the cookies, not their grandmother. The children crash the wedding ceremony and expose their mother to the guests and the groom; Corinne refuses to acknowledge the children as her own or to admit to poisoning Cory. Cathy offers her an arsenic-coated cookie as a wedding present, and in fury tries to force her mother to eat it, chasing her out to a balcony, where after a brief struggle, Corinne falls and is killed when her veil is caught on a trellis, breaking her neck. Afterward, the children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn; the narrator  explains that the children did manage to survive all by themselves although Carrie was \\'never truly healthy\\'. She wonders aloud if her grandmother is still alive, anticipating Cathy\\'s eventual return to claim the family\\'s fortune.'},\n",

The fortress contains a bomb capable of destroying half the planet. The Nebulans threaten to use it if they are attacked. The starship Yamato is launched from a secret base and tasked with finding the Black Nebulan home planet, from where the bomb is controlled. The Black Nebula is a double spiral galaxy near the Milky Way. The disc facing Earth is made of black, inert matter obscuring all light from the other disc, so the galaxy has never been seen before. There are three new crew members. Shiro Kato, the original Kato's  younger brother. Sasha is the daughter of Starsha and Mamoru Kodai, and has grown from an infant to a teen in only 1 Earth year. The third new member is Captain Yamanami. The Yamato reaches the other side of the Black Nebula and finds a grand, white galaxy, similar to the Milky Way. They follow a beacon signal to a planet that looks just like Earth. They land, and are greeted by an apparently human woman, Sada, and two officers from the Black Nebulan Empire. They meet the Emperor, Scaldart, who also appears to be a human. He tells them that they are actually back in the Milky Way, in the year 2402. The vortex was a hole in time. The Earth has been under Black Nebulan rule for 200 years, and he is the  governor. Scaldart shows Kodai and the landing party all sorts of collections of Earth's famous artwork, and, up on the Yamato, the video screen scans the surface of the planet to find all of Earth's famous landmarks. Scaldart shows them a time viewing machine which shows the history of the Yamato from 2199 up until the present. Then he shows them the future. The Yamato, orbitting the Earth, is destroyed by the enemy's flagship, the Grodaze, in 2402. The landing crew returns, demoralized, to the Yamato... except for Sasha who seems to know her true destiny. She abandons the party and remains on conquered Earth. while alone on the surface, her mother Starsha appears in a vision. She tells Sasha that she was born between Iscandar and Earth, and that her destiny is to die far from both, in service of both. In orbit, the Yamato is attacked by the Grodaze and its fleet, with Beta particle guns firing on the ship. But the Yamato isn't destroyed as predicted. Sanada surmises that the people the planet was not really human and all of the artwork used as proof were fakes. Could the Earth below them be fake, too? The Yamato fires its Wave Motion Gun at the Grodaze and its fleet, destroying them. But, the tachyon based energy of the Wave Gun has an unexpected reaction with the beta particle energy from the exploding enemy ships. A huge explosion hits the Earth, destroying much of the surface. The Earth, where Sasha remained, dissolves in fire. The fire reveals the black skeleton of a planet. It is not Earth, but the Black Nebulan home planet of Dezarium. It was an elaborate hoax designed to demoralize and defeat the Yamato. Scaldart pulls off the mask he wore to reveal his true Black Nebulan face. Back on Earth, Lt. Arufon frees Yuki, who leads an assault on the fortress. She has a showdown with Arufon, but he is shot by another Earth trooper. Arufon tells her that his people are a race of cyborgs, who gave up their flesh for longer lives as Mechanisms. But they also lost the ability to love in the process. Arufon gives Yuki the plans to the fortress, including instructions on how to disarm its hyperion bomb, and dies in her arms. Sasha manages to survive the incineration of the surface by escaping to the planet's lower levels. She finds a control center and sends a message to the Yamato, telling them that to destroy Dezarium, they must travel to the core through a huge conduit she is about to open. Scaldart announces after her message that if the Yamato proceeds any further, he will detonate the hyperon bomb on Earth. Yuki's radio message interrupts Scaldart, telling the Yamato that she is alive, the invaders and their fortress have been immobilized and that the hyperion bomb has been disarmed. The Yamato speeds though the conduit, dodging all sorts of enemy fire. It reaches the center of the planet where it finds a huge crystal city, looking like a glass sea urchin. The Yamato is hit by a missile and Captain Yamanami is killed. Kodai prepares the Wave Gun, but stops when he realizes this will also kill Sasha. Sasha again radios the Yamato, insisting that they fire since this is her destiny. Scaldart finds and shoots Sasha. An enraged Kodai fires the Wave Gun. The blast sets off an explosive chain reaction. The Yamato does a 180-degree turn and rushes out of the internal chamber, going to emergency warp when it reaches the conduit exit. Dezarium explodes behind them, destroying the delicate gravitational balance between the two sides of the Double Galaxy. They crash into each other, starting the birth of a new galaxy. The Yamato warps home while Yuki looks towards the glowing horizon for their return.\"},\n",

The story is presented chronologically here. Moth is an ordinary guy from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. At school, he falls in love with the beautiful Ada , later nicknamed \"Mantis\". Out of a desire for money, he agrees to work for a shady neighbour known as Slug . The two plot the theft of a black diamond from the white émigré jeweller Vlad the Bijou\\'s house. The robbery ends in failure as Moth is wounded by The Bijou and captured by the police; Slug manages to escape and is never charged. There is no trace of the diamond, and as Vlad is killed by Slug during the robbery, the police never get to know of its existence. In the Sofia prison, Moth, besides working out to patriotic Soviet music, also befriends his older roommate Van Wurst the Eye , so nicknamed because he has been wearing an ocular prosthesis after losing one of his eyes during a robbery in Barcelona. Besides being an avid boxer and arm wrestler, Van Wurst also has his philosophical views on life, such as a theory about the destructive power of women, which he shares with Moth. Shortly before being released, Van Wurst hangs himself, claiming \"there is no hope outside\". While in prison, Moth is informed by Ada that his son Leonid was born and died of lockjaw while still very young. As Moth is released from prison afterwards, he picks up his civil clothes and his year-old ball of chewing bitumen from the cloakroom and does not miss the chance to swear at an obnoxious guard, who headbutts him to unconsciousness. Outside, Moth is picked by a warrant officer and a younger soldier who drive him in a Chaika to the Baths. In the damp basement of the Baths, he is interrogated and tortured by Slug, now a locally influential member of the communist nomenklatura, who believes Moth knows the location of the black diamond. Moth denies and even doubts the diamond ever existed; he later manages to escape, but not before he consumes iridium-poisoned wine offered to him by Slug. Wandering drunk and intoxicated around Sofia and seeking his old girlfriend Ada, Moth gets to witness the new socialist reality he had only heard about on the prison radio: the look of the city has changed with The Largo and the Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, but the nature of the people has remained essentially the same. The protagonist meets a variety of bizarre characters, such as drug-doing medics, weird patients and local drunks. He ends up in the Saint Nicholas Church, where he meets the priest who had baptized him ; the priest points him to Ada\\'s current whereabouts as a performer in a nightclub under the stage name Gilda .{{cite web}} Moth finds Ada, who is now living with Slug, and has sex with her. He later reveals to Ada that he is aware of the diamond\\'s location: in Vlad the Bijou\\'s coffin. The two go to the graveyard, where Moth first insists to visit the grave of his son. However, he realizes that it is another Leonid\\'s grave  and that he never actually had a son. At the same time he notices Slug standing behind him with Ada, who had apparently betrayed him. The three head to The Bijou\\'s grave; while digging, Moth kills Slug with his pickaxe, but is fatally wounded and stunned by Ada a moment later. Moth wakes up in the gravediggers\\' shed. Realizing his impending death, he asks for his bitumen in order not to die with a foul breath. Tearing the bitumen apart, Moth reveals the black diamond had been stashed within it for all those years. He swallows the diamond and dies.'},\n",

If robbing a don's residence was not enough, the quarter also manage to get in the way of a 'poetic' spouting Intelligence agent VP Singh  keeping tabs on the don, an underworld patriarch Khan  and an East Asian thug named Asif trying to trace his stolen car. Pretty soon, all the characters of the film are pulled in a cat and mouse game with each other, with some audio tapes containing some damning conversations being the prize of the game. In the climax, the quartet, with some help by a local hustler Varinder  and his moll Sharmili  manage to set off the bad guys against each other. But soon enough, it is revealed that Batliwala was behind the whole thing, and wanted to set the quartet up to get revenge on his brother who is now in jail because of them. The quartet manage to save themselves and hire Khan to murder Batliwala.\"},\n",

Undergoing extreme mental and physical training, they become virtual sociopaths, with no understanding of anything except military routine and war. A priority of the conditioning is that these soldiers are forbidden to speak unless spoken to, completely ignore physical pain, and to address whomever they are speaking to, women included, as \"sir\". At age 38, Todd  is a hardened veteran of many battles, but he and his unit are about to be replaced. Colonel Mekum  introduces a new group of genetically-engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotions except aggression. Todd\\'s unit\\'s commander, Captain Church  insists on testing the \"new\" soldiers\\' abilities against his own. But Todd, the unit\\'s best soldier, is no match for Caine 607 . In the final trial, a fight between Caine and three \"old\" soldiers, two of Todd\\'s comrades are killed, though Todd manages to gouge out one of Caine\\'s eyes before he is defeated. Todd seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious. Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining \"old\" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles. Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high wind velocities. Though badly injured, Todd limps his way toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet\\'s ubiquitous mountains of trash. Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has great difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning. Todd\\'s prior training of not speaking unless spoken to  make it difficult for him to answer questions in anything more than curt replies, and actually initiating a conversation is impossible for him. Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is sheltered by a settler named Mace  and his wife Sandra . Todd develops a silent rapport with the couple\\'s mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized mentally and physically by a snakebite. In a subsequent conflict with a curled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself; however, his parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd\\'s apparent instability. Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the colonists  for an enemy, nearly killing him. The settlers decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and order him to leave. Outside the colony, he sheds tears. He is confused, not understanding what they are, implying that this is the first time that he has cried. Shortly thereafter, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, and are saved at the last second by Nathan, using Todd\\'s technique. Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect himself from the snakes and that he has an important role to play in their community, and decides to leave on his own to find and bring him back. The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on a training exercise. Since the planet is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the colonists\\' presence is unlawful and, as practice, orders his troops to slaughter them. Spotted by the arriving troops, Mace is killed just after he finds Todd. Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd\\'s years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the settlers. Nervous that a much larger enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum, grudgingly accepting Captain Church\\'s advice, orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmanoeuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is finished off in hand-to-hand combat. Panicking, Mekum orders his ship\\'s crew, composed of Todd\\'s old squad, to activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the entire planet, then orders the ship to lift off before they are back on board. When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades, now recognizing him as the ranking officer as a side effect of their conditioning due to their dismissal by Mekum, silently side with him over the army that has discarded them. Todd and his comrades take over the ship, tossing Mekum and his aides out onto the planet, and evacuating the remaining colonists just as the bomb detonates. Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists\\' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.

While being revived, the dazed caveman is alarmed by the surgical-masked figures; only Shephard has the presence of mind to remove his mask and reveal his humanity and somewhat familiar face to the terrified caveman, permitting the caveman to settle back into a more peaceful sleep and make a full recovery.

An eminent linguist is brought to the Arctic base to help understand Charlie\\'s language. As Shephard begins to communicate with Charlie, he realizes that he will never be able to help Charlie understand that the world and community he came from have long since disappeared. This fact is made even more poignant when Shephard introduces Charlie to a female colleague. Assuming that the woman is Shephard\\'s mate, Charlie makes chalk marks which indicate that he likely was a married man with children before he was frozen. Shephard strives to understand what motivates Charlie and why, of all the cavemen, he should survive being frozen. At one point, Shephard begins to sing \"Heart of Gold\", inspiring Charlie to sing one of his own songs. Charlie\\'s seemingly incidental bird-like line drawings in the ground resembling body markings on his chest take on a new significance when the base\\'s helicopter strays over the roof of the base\\'s artificial tropical eco-zone, causing Charlie to take on an almost obsessive zeal as he climbs towards the roof. Shouting the word Beedha over and over, he lifts his arms towards the helicopter in a sign of obvious worship. Even though the helicopter pulls away from the dome, Shephard knows that Charlie can now think of nothing else. Charlie escapes after watching Shephard exit the biosphere and in a panic of seeing unfamiliar modern devices and believing there are enemies, spears Maynard. Recapturing Charlie, the other scientists, led by Dr. Singe , focus on what they can learn from him, using him as a subject rather than a person. They attempt to re-freeze the iceman in order to study the effect of thawing on Charlie\\'s physiology and determine what benefit may result. The incident goes awry as Charlie nearly dies in the attempt. Shephard consults local Inuit who recognize the name that Charlie chanted and explain that it is a mythical bird -- a messenger from the gods who comes to take good people to heaven, while sinners are sent to a kind of purgatory. Shephard has long known that Charlie has a spiritual dimension and now sees that he was on a dreamwalk pilgrimage, a mythical quest for redemption. His people were dying in the sudden ice age; he must have offered himself to the gods in the form of a self-sacrifice or appealing to the gods to redeem his tribe. Shephard defies all protocol to help Charlie to escape, because he realizes that Charlie would never survive in the modern world, and Charlie\\'s peace-of-mind and fulfillment are of prime importance to Shephard. Delighted with his freedom, Charlie races on ahead of Shephard as they pass by glaciers and vast ice-shelves, and a crevasse opens up in front of Shephard, cutting him off from Charlie. Meanwhile, the other personnel give chase. The helicopter emerges over an ice-shelf before Charlie. Shephard looks on helplessly as Charlie climbs up towards the aircraft and grabs hold of one of its landing skis. In an attempt to evade Charlie\\'s grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky. The co-pilot offers a hand to Charlie to save him, but an elated and ecstatic Charlie cries out and releases the aircraft, seeming to float through the sky while he plunges. Shephard\\'s initial horror turns into joy as he realizes that Charlie has reached his goal.'},\n",

Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds  and other large dogs. Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden. The body belonged to a young woman that died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's.

Gilbert Grape  is busy caring for his mentally disabled brother, Arnie , as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during their early camp ritual at a nearby recreational area. His mother, Bonnie  is morbidly obese after years of depression following her husband's suicide by hanging himself. She hasn't left the house in years, and is always found sitting on the sofa watching television. With Bonnie unable to care for them by herself, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing their shanty of a farmhouse while looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing up the town water tower if left unsupervised for too long. All the while his older sister Amy  and younger sister Ellen  slave away in the kitchen. The relationship between the brothers is one of care and protection. In order to cope with his frenetic life, Gilbert has taken on a secret love affair with a housewife, Betty , whilst her insensitive, unsuspecting husband Ken , is fully intent on selling Gilbert insurance for his family. A new chain supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery store where Gilbert works, as well as threatening all the other small-time businesses in Endora. The chain supermarket stocks all kinds of goods, rendering many of the local shops redundant. While the family prepares for Arnie's upcoming 18th birthday party, a young woman named Becky  and her grandmother are stuck in town when their truck towing their trailer breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. In order to spend time with Becky watching the sun set, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bathtub by himself, believing he is now old enough to get out on his own. He returns home late and wakes up the following morning to find Arnie still in the bath, shivering in the now-cold water. He puts a towel around him but yet again Gilbert gets the blame for leaving him. Gilbert's guilt is compounded by his family's anger. As a result Arnie refuses to get near water, including the pond by Becky's trailer, and his fear causes him to become extremely dirty, adding to the many problems Gilbert faces. Betty's affair with Gilbert ends when she begins to make demands on him and tries to have sex with him while he's on the phone with her husband. Ken drowns after suffering a cardiac arrest and landing face down in his sons' wading pool. Many of the townspeople believe Betty killed her husband, despite the insistence of Gilbert's friend, Bobby McBurney , one of the town coroners, who believes he died of cardiac arrest. Besides Bobby, Gilbert is the only one who believed Betty didn't commit murder. She eventually leaves town in search of a new life. Becky bonds with Gilbert and Arnie and helps Gilbert reflect on his feelings. They become deeply involved in conversation until Gilbert realizes that Arnie is missing. He has returned to the water tower he is forever trying to climb and this time has succeeded at getting to the top. Arnie is arrested, compelling Bonnie, who has not left the house in seven years, to rush to the police station to demand his release, causing her appearance to be ridiculed by the townspeople. Later at home, Arnie wonders what is in a big box that Gilbert had left in the fridge. He finds a birthday cake and gets caught eating it, which Gilbert told him not to touch. Gilbert orders Arnie to take a bath as punishment, and Arnie resists when Gilbert tries to force him. Losing his temper, Gilbert strikes Arnie hard making him bleed. Appalled at himself and angry at his life in general, Gilbert drives away, leaving Endora. Arnie leaves the house to find Becky, who takes care of him. Gilbert returns to town and sees Arnie with Becky, who is able to get him to enter the lake. Arnie falls from a branch in a tree and goes in the lake, thus helping him overcome his fear of water.

After the final rites of his wife, Muthiah decides to stay in the village to re-live the days he spent with his deceased wife. Ramanathan  comes to his father to ask for some financial help by selling their family home in the village and Muthiah gets upset. While upset, the father slips and falls into a well. He is treated in the hospital, but the father succumbs to his injuries and passes away. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships too, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story however revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well-being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people. It also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well-being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family. It is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles—the father by actor Rajkiran and role of the mother by actress Saranya Ponvannan. The director, Cheran, has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children. The modern viewer can appreciate the life lessons witnessed in Cheran's Thavamai Thavamirundhu.\"},\n",

After expressing their different views on how they want to spend their vacation, Mori  becomes concerned that his grandchildren are growing apart, both from himself and from each other. Tum-Tum seems to be the only one interested in traveling to Japan, and even then only hopes to go and watch Sumo wrestlers due to the amount of food they are able to consume every day, while Mori intends to return a dagger to the Grand Master at a martial arts tournament that he had won 50 years prior from a boy named Koga . Meanwhile, in Japan, a figure dressed in all black ninja attire sneaks into a museum. After defeating several guards, the mysterious figure makes off with a valuable sword and escapes via a hang glider into the night. In the U.S., a baseball game determines that the three ninjas are experiencing the pains of growing up. Colt has become impatient and very short-tempered, starting fights with several of the bigger bullies on the opposing team. Rocky is very easily distracted by the school hottie Lisa D. Marino , and Tum-Tum\\'s self obsession with food breaks several plays, though not before a very flatulent batter breaks wind, causing the youngest of the Douglases to pass out. A huge in-game fight causes the umpire to call off the championship game, delaying it a week, driving a nail into Mori\\'s plans to take his grandchildren to Japan as they wish to remain and finish the game. Enroute to the airport, a sticker falls off Tum-Tum\\'s bag, and Sam picks up the wrong one, thinking it is Mori\\'s bag. After Mori departs, the kids discover three intruders at Mori\\'s house and fend off the property. Little do they realize that the trio is led by Koga\\'s platinum rocker haired nephew, Glam  and his friends who were sent to steal the dagger from Mori. After a call from Mori that a fender bender put him into a hospital, the boys discover that Tum-Tum has Mori\\'s bag with the dagger inside. They decide to, without their parents\\' knowledge or permission, use a recording of their conversation with Mori to authorize plane tickets to Japan. Upon their arrival, they reveal to Mori that they have the dagger, and he instructs them to deliver it to the Grand Master. Disguised as nurses, Glam and his friends record their conversation and deliver it to Koga, who punishes them for not once but three times failing to deliver the dagger, before creating a plan to get it back. The boys attend the tournament, and Colt, dressed as a participant is not only painfully defeated, but by a girl named Miyo , a baseball enthusiast as well, but with no skill in the sport whatsoever. She offers the boys a place to stay and in return for training in baseball, she will teach them some of her martial arts skill. Rocky develops an attraction for Miyo, and puts aside his shame for having to use reading glasses as she has a pair of her own. The Grand Master pays a visit, but the boys and Miyo are suspicious when he speaks English to them, as he had previously been unable to and Miyo had to translate for him. As well as wearing a pair of black shoes whereas before he was barefoot. When Miyo discovers the deception, she warns the boys who find out that it is in fact Koga in disguise. He sends his henchmen after the children who soundly defeat most of the troop before they are themselves captured. At the same time, Mori is taken from the hospital after a botched attempt from Glam and his friends to secure him themselves. They are all reunited, and Koga threatens the boys\\' lives unless Mori relinquishes his dagger. Mori agrees, and they travel to a hidden cave, which the sword and the dagger are keys to unlock the doorway to lead them to a legendary Cave of Gold. After escaping their captivity, Rocky, Colt, Tum-Tum and Miyo take hang gliders to catch up with Mori and Koga, arriving in the cave they battle and elude each of Koga\\'s men. Mori and Koga discover the cave of Gold, and as Koga readies to shoot Mori, the children arrive, prompting Koga to instead try to kill all of them. Remembering training that Mori taught him about patience, Colt manages to throw a small ninja ball into the barrel of the gun, causing it to back-fire. The explosion causes the cave to begin to collapse and all six of them manage to escape the cave. After realizing what the greed had done to him, Koga throws the sword into the cave, closing the door forever. After Koga apologizes to Mori and the children for his behavior, Mori presents Miyo, the new champion of the martial arts tournament with the dagger as he was presented it 50 years ago. They then realize that they can make it back to the United States before the championship game. When they return, they overcome their flaws.

              "  'plot': 'The fishing town of Antonio Bay in California is about to celebrate its centennial. With preparations for the celebration underway, the centennial is also marked by a series of ominous events; as the witching hour strikes and the date of the town\\'s centennial begins, various odd phenomena begin to happen all over the sleeping town - objects move by themselves, television sets turn themselves on, gas stations seemingly come to life, and all the public payphones ring simultaneously. That same night, Father Malone, the town\\'s alcoholic priest, is in his study in the church when a large piece of stone falls from the wall revealing a cavity. Inside is an old journal, his grandfather\\'s diary from a hundred years earlier. Father Malone removes the book from the wall and begins to read. The diary reveals that in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay  deliberately sank and plundered a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane. The ship was owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. During a foggy night, the six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the ship, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship. A supernaturally glowing fog appears, spreading over the sea and moving against the wind. Three local fishermen are out at sea getting drunk when the fog covers their trawler. When two of them go on deck to investigate, they see a ghostly looking clipper ship pulling alongside their trawler. The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper ship\\'s crew, who have come back on the hundredth anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to take the lives of six people: symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators. Two of the fishermen are attacked and slaughtered on deck, while the third is killed in the wheelhouse. At the same time, town resident Nick Castle drives down a country road and picks up a young female hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. While the two drive towards town, the radio and headlights of Nick\\'s truck start to fail and all the windows inexplicably shatter. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood, part of a board, that was found on the beach by her young son Andy. The wood is inscribed with the word \"DANE\". Intrigued by the object, Stevie keeps it and takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show from. Stevie sets the board down on top of a tape player that is playing, and while she is momentarily distracted, the board inexplicably begins to seep water. The water spreads and causes the tape player to short out. Suddenly, a mysterious man\\'s voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, and the words \"6 Must Die\" appear on the wood before it bursts into flames. A shocked Stevie quickly extinguishes the fire, but then she sees that the board once again reads \"DANE\" and the tape player begins working normally again. After locating the missing trawler, Nick and Elizabeth find the corpse of Dick Baxter with his eyes gouged out. The other two fishermen are nowhere to be found. The body is taken to the local coroner\\'s office to be examined by Dr. Phibes, who is perplexed by the body\\'s advanced state of decomposition considering Baxter died only hours earlier. Whilst Elizabeth is alone in the autopsy room with Baxter\\'s corpse, the body becomes momentarily re-animated. It rises from the autopsy table and grabs Elizabeth. As Elizabeth screams, Nick and Phibes rush back into the autopsy room, where they see the corpse lifeless again on the floor. However, it appears to have scratched the number \"3\" into the floor with the scalpel. Baxter was the third victim to die. While this is happening, Kathy Williams, the wife of one of the missing fishermen and one of the driving forces behind the town\\'s centennial, and her assistant Sandy Fadel visit Father Malone to ask him to give the benediction at that night\\'s ceremony. He reads to them from the journal and reveals to them how the town was founded on murder and their celebration would be honoring murderers which is something the two women do not want to hear. That evening, the Antonio Bay centennial celebration begins in the center of town. Kathy is told by the sheriff and Nick about her husband\\'s disappearance, but insists on going on with her part in the ceremonies. At the same time, Dan, the local weatherman, calls Stevie at the radio station to tell her that another fog bank has appeared and is moving towards town. As they are talking, the fog gathers outside the weather station and Dan hears a knock at the door. Leaving Stevie on the phone while he goes to answer it, Dan is killed by the ghosts as Stevie listens in horror. As Stevie continues her radio broadcast, the fog begins moving inland and neutralizes the town\\'s phone and electricity lines. Using a back-up generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son when she sees the fog closing in from her lighthouse vantage point. Nick and Elizabeth hear this on the car radio and go to help. Meanwhile, at Stevie\\'s home, her son\\'s babysitter, Mrs. Kobritz, is killed by the ghosts as the fog envelops the house. The ghosts then pursue Andy, but Nick arrives just in time to save him and they escape. As the town\\'s celebration comes to an end, Kathy and Sandy are driving home when they turn on the car radio and hear Stevie warning people about the dangerous fog that is sweeping through the town. Stevie advises everyone to go to the local church, which appears to be the only safe place. Nick, Elizabeth and Andy hear the same message and the group gather at the church. Once inside, they and Father Malone take refuge in a small back room as the fog begins to roll outside. Inside the room, Nick and Father Malone find a huge gold cross buried in the walls. The cross is made of the gold that was stolen from Blake and his people a hundred years earlier. As the ghosts of Blake and his crew begin to attack the church, Father Malone takes the gold cross out into the chapel. Knowing he is the offspring of one of the conspirators, Malone confronts Blake in an attempt to sacrifice himself and save everyone else. Back at the lighthouse, two of the ghosts try to attack Stevie. She climbs onto the roof, but the ghosts follow and trap her. Inside the church, Blake seizes the golden cross, which begins to emit an eerie glow. The church rumbles as the light emanating from the cross becomes brighter and brighter. Nick manages to pull Father Malone away from the cross only seconds before it disappears, along with Blake and his crew, in a blinding flash of light. The ghosts attacking Stevie on the roof of the lighthouse disappear as well, and the fog vanishes. Stevie gets back on air and warns the boats out at sea to watch out for the fog. Later that evening, Father Malone is alone in the church pondering why Blake did not kill him and thus take six lives. At that moment, the fog reappears inside the church along with Blake and his crew. As Father Malone turns to face him, Blake swings his sword at Father Malone\\'s neck, decapitating him.'},\n",

After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chan sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau\\'s face clearly. He attempts to follow Lau secretly as they leave, but loses his target when his phone rings suddenly at the crucial moment. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double identities – Chan starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background. When Chan meets Wong again on the same rooftop, Wong intends to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. They are unaware that Lau has his subordinate, CIB Inspector B, and his team tracking him. Meanwhile, Hon sends Tsui Wai-keung, Del Piero, and a gang of henchmen to confront them after receiving intel from Lau. Inspector B informs Lau and sends an OCTB squad to save Wong. Chan flees from the building using a crane while Wong sacrifices himself to save Chan by distracting the thugs. Wong is recognised by the gangsters, who beat him up severely before throwing him off the roof. As the police close in, a shootout breaks out, resulting in three gangsters being killed, one of whom is Piero. In the aftermath of the gunfight, the OCTB squad arrives with Lau and Wong\\'s second-in-command, Inspector Cheung, on the scene. Lau retrieves Wong\\'s cellphone and contacts Chan, with both of them reaching an agreement to foil a drug deal by Hon. The plan succeeds and many of Hon\\'s men are arrested, while Lau betrays Hon and kills him. Everything seems to have returned to normal – Chan can revert to his true identity as a cop, while Lau has erased his criminal connections by eliminating Hon\\'s triad. However, back at the police station, Chan discovers that Lau was the mole and he leaves immediately. Lau, realising what has happened, erases Chan\\'s records as a cop from the police database. Chan spends an evening with his therapist Lee , with whom he has fallen in love. He sends to Lau a compact disc with a recording that Hon kept between himself and Lau, but the disc is inadvertently intercepted by Lau\\'s girlfriend Mary . Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau without resistance and holds his Glock 17 to Lau\\'s head, as a rebuke to Lau\\'s plea for forgiveness and request to remain as a cop. Inspector B arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into an elevator, but upon moving his head from behind Lau he is suddenly shot in the head by Inspector B. Inspector B then reveals to Lau that he is also a mole planted by Hon. As they take the elevator down to the lobby, Lau kills B, most likely out of his desire to eradicate traces of his past and become a \"good guy\" cop and end the hunt for a mole. The original ending climaxes with Lau identifying himself to the police as one of them. Dr. Lee Sum-yee discovers Yip\\'s records at the academy, revealing Chan as the undercover officer; B is blamed of being the mole and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral, with Cheung and Lee present as well. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life. In Mainland China, an alternate ending for the film was created. In this ending, Lau exits the elevator and is informed by Cheung that the police have found evidence that he was a mole. Lau hands them his badge and is arrested without protest. The sequel, Infernal Affairs III, uses the original ending instead of the alternate one.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie , the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie\\'s replacement is Brian Clough , the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie\\'s management. Furthermore, Clough\\'s longtime assistant, Peter Taylor , has not joined him. The roots of Clough\\'s conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First DivisionThough Leeds were leading the table, they did not win the league that season, eventually finishing fourth. The eventual winners were Manchester City and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2&ndash;0.Although Leeds did beat Derby 2&ndash;0 in the FA Cup that season, in reality the game was played at United\\'s Elland Road ground. It was the second of three games between the two sides that season, the FA Cup tie being sandwiched between the two legs of a Football League Cup Semi-Final. Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay , along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson  is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5&ndash;0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson\\'s advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner ([[Stephen Graham  sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them easily, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.In fact, the match between Derby and Leeds took place before Derby\\'s quarter-final match, which they won despite their injury list. Their eventual defeat by Juventus was with a nearly full-strength squad, and Clough blamed Juventus\\'s gamesmanship, rather than Sam Longson for Derby\\'s exit. Later that year, after Taylor suffers a heart attack, Clough tries to secure his position by offering up his and Taylor\\'s resignations. To his horror, the club\\'s board call his bluff, terminates their contracts and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again . Derby fans\\' outrage raises Clough\\'s hopes of being reinstated, but Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. During the holiday, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives.The film shows him effectively reneging on his deal to take over at Brighton, although in reality he had nine relatively unsuccessful months as manager there. Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways. Back in the storyline\\'s \"present,\" Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they \"never won any of them fairly,\" and then making them start with a 7-a-side game. The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough\\'s debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds\\'s captain, Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match on penalties, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough\\'s contract - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted and fundamentally dishonest, both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time . After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor\\'s dictation, but they reconcile. In the film\\'s epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie proved a complete failure as an England manager, and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor meanwhile reunited at Nottingham Forest, where he repeated his prior achievements with Derby by taking them up and winning the First Division, and this time bettered both Revie and his own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession. The film ends by branding Clough \"the best manager that the English national side never had.\"'},\n",

Then it rewinds up to the events leading to that scene. Zack's step-brother, Darren, is the complete opposite of him. He likes to spend time in front of the computer, and he doesn't associate himself much with other people. He likes to swim, and is a part of Zack's swimming team, although he just swims because he likes it. A bubbly and intelligent girl, named Xandrie, takes a liking to him. To spend more time with Darren, she decides to attend one of Zack's extravagant house parties with her friend, Ella. Meanwhile, Zack's friends notice her infatuation with Darren, and Zack's interest on her. During the party, Xandrie fails to meet up with Darren; they were unable to find each other in the crowd. Zack's friends, Simone and Karenn, put something on Xandrie's drink and takes her and Ella in the basement, where Zack and his other friends are. Inside, Xandrie experiences the effects of the drug and subsequently falls out of consciousness, and Zack and his friends assault and rape her. Meanwhile, Darren, barred by Brook from following her, decides to go back to his room and falls asleep instead. Zack, Brook and Jonathan take Xandrie to the beach, and leaves her for dead. The next morning, Darren finds Xandrie's phone in the basement, and at school, he is unable to find her. Even Ella doesn't know where she is. Darren confronts Zack, who denies knowing where she is. Meanwhile, Darren hallucinates about Xandrie, regretting how he wasn't able to spend much time with her. Wanting answers, Darren questions Jonathan and beats him up, but he is unable to get answers from him. He tracks Xandrie's home address and visits her, but she isn't home. A few days pass, and Xandrie becomes the topic of negative rumors. But Xandrie returns, much to the surprise of everyone, especially Darren. While with Ella, Xandrie is approached by Karenn and Simone, with the former subtly warning her that it's only her word against theirs. Xandrie then subsequently remembers what happened after waking up at the beach. She went home and ignored Darren while he knocked on her home. Darren, still wanting to find out about what really happened, sneaks and downloads some files off of Jonathan's laptop. He finds out about what really happened, and dreams of killing those responsible. Darren finds time to see Xandrie, and offers her phone back, but she declines. Darren convinces her about not being part of what happened. She rejects his apology, saying that everyone's already made up their mind about what really happened. Unable to sway her, Darren goes home, remembering how he first met Zack. Meanwhile, Zack visits Xandrie at her house, and tells her to keep her mouth shut because no one is going to believe her anyway. Beneath his solid demeanor, Zack feels the guilt as he thinks about the consequences of his and his friends' actions. Darren meets up with Xandrie late at night, and she tells him that she's planning on leaving, calling their school a parallel universe. The two eventually make up. The next day, Xandrie arrives at the school with a gun, and meets up with Darren. Meanwhile, Zack and Brook talk about how Darren is a liability, and Zack allows Brook to beat him up. Brook finds him just as Xandrie left, and punches him in the face. Darren runs and Brook gives him a chase inside the library. Darren sees Xandrie there, contemplating while holding the gun. The two eventually attract a crowd. Jonathan traps Darren with the crowd of students, and Brook proceeds to beat him up. Zack arrives and walks in, telling Darren that he deserves it because he went against him. He asks Brook and Jonathan to escort him out and fix the mess. Xandrie arrives in front of him, pointing the gun right in front of his face. Zack warns her that killing him won't change anything; she still won't convince everyone that she isn't crazy and that he's innocent. While outside with Brook still beating him up, Darren hears a gunshot from the inside, with everyone running out. Dizzy, he manages to go in, and sees Xandrie's dead body, who apparently committed suicide, unable to shoot Zack. The following days, Zack throws another party. Meanwhile, Darren devices a plan with his friend, Shay O'Brien, and coerces him into making Zack comment on his friends negatively, and films it. Meanwhile, Darren convinces Simone to drug Zack's drink, to which she reluctantly agrees because of his threats. Everyone in the party finds out about the video Darren let out, with Brook and Jonathan finding out about Shay's conversation with Zack. Various televisions inside house open up, revealing two empty seats, much to everyone's confusion. Zack goes and follows Darren  in the basement, but he falls unconscious. When he wakes up, he is bound in one of the seats, with Darren pointing a gun at him. Everyone in the party watches while this happens, and Darren needs the votes of the students through text, in order to find out who should be killed. He sits beside Zack, and waits as the students send their votes via text message. A gun devised by Darren automatically kills one of them, depending on who gets the most votes. The gun eventually shoots, apparently killing one of them.\"},\n",

He plays war in the woods, attends a Fourth of July parade, plays and wins at a local neighborhood baseball game, and watches President John F. Kennedy\\'s inaugural address, which later inspires him to enlist in the Marines. After Ron Kovic and his classmates hear an impassioned lecture about the Marine Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom because he is unable to secure a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving. The film then moves to Kovic\\'s second Vietnam tour in October 1967. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, named Wilson. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsmen present who try to save him, Wilson later dies from his wounds, leaving a deep impression on Kovic. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer , who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO. The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol in January 1968. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded and trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. The hospital living conditions are deplorable: rats crawl freely on the floors, the staff is generally apathetic to their patients\\' needs, doctors visit the patients infrequently, drug use is rampant , and equipment is too old and ill-maintained to be useful. He desperately tries to walk again with the use of crutches and braces, despite repeated warnings from his doctors. However, he soon suffers a bad fall that causes a compound fracture of his thighbone. The injury nearly robs him of his leg, and he vehemently argues with the doctors who briefly consider resorting to amputation. Ron returns home, permanently in a wheelchair, with his leg intact. From the start, he notices how all his family and friends treat him differently now that he is paralyzed. He begins to alienate his family and friends, complaining about students staging anti-war rallies across the country and burning the American flag. Though he tries to maintain his dignity as a Marine, Ron gradually becomes disillusioned, feeling the effects of his paralysis on his life, and realizes that all the things he was taught from birth, like honor, patriotism, and courage, were illusions which he would give up any day to get his legs back. In Ron\\'s absence, his younger brother Tommy has already become staunchly anti-war, remarking to Ron directly in his face what the war had done to him, leading to a rift between them. His highly religious mother also seems unable to deal with Ron\\'s new attitude as a resentful, paralyzed veteran. His problems are as much psychological as they are physical and he quickly becomes alcoholic and belligerent. During an Independence Day parade, he shows signs of post-traumatic stress when firecrackers explode and when a baby in the crowd starts crying. He reunites with his old high school friend, Timmy Burns, who is also a wounded veteran, and the two spend Ron\\'s birthday sharing war stories. Later, Ron goes to visit Donna at her college in Syracuse, New York. The two reminisce and she asks him to attend a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings. However, he cannot do so, because his chair prevents him from getting very far on campus because of curbs and stairways. He and Donna are separated after she and her fellow students are captured and taken away by the police at her college for demonstrating a protest against the Vietnam War. After returning home drunk one night after having a barroom confrontation with a World War II veteran who expresses no sympathy to Ron, Ron\\'s disillusionment grows severe enough that he has an intense fight with his mother, yelling at her that there was no God, and that they murdered civilians in Vietnam in disregard of Christian morals. Ron travels to a small town in Mexico  that seems to be a haven for paralyzed Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute he believes he\\'s in love with. Ron wants to ask her to marry him but when he sees her with another customer, the realization of real love versus a mere physical sexual experience sets in, and he decides against it. Hooking up with another wheelchair-using veteran, Charlie, who is furious over a prostitute\\'s mocking his lack of sexual function due to his paralysis, the two travel to what they believe will be a friendlier village. After annoying their taxicab driver, they end up stranded on the side of the road. They quarrel and fight about what each of them had really done in Vietnam, knocking each other out of their wheelchairs. Eventually, they are picked up by a man with a truck and eventually driven back to the \"Village of the Sun\". On his way back to Long Island, Ron makes a side trek to Georgia to visit the parents and family of Wilson, the Marine he accidentally killed during his tour. He tells them the real story about how their son died and confesses his guilt to them. Wilson\\'s widow, now the mother of the deceased Marine\\'s toddler son, admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive him for killing her husband, but adds that maybe God can. Wilson\\'s parents, however, are more forgiving and even sympathetic to his predicament and suffering, because Wilson\\'s father fought in the Pacific Theater during World War II and is disillusioned with the war in Vietnam. In spite of the mixed reactions he receives, the confession seems to lift a heavy weight from Ron\\'s conscience. Ron joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War  and travels to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami. He and his compatriots force their way into the convention hall during Richard Nixon\\'s acceptance speech and cause a commotion that makes it onto the national news. Ron himself tells a reporter about his negative experiences in Vietnam and the VA hospital conditions, that the Vietnam war is wrong, and tells him that the Vietnamese people are a proud people fighting against the US for their independence, fueling rage from the surrounding Nixon supporters. His interview is cut short when guards eject him and his fellow vets from the hall and attempt to turn them over to the police. They manage to break free from the police, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not so successfully this time. The film ends with Kovic\\'s speaking at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, shortly after the publication of his autobiography, Born on the Fourth of July.'},\n",

Eventually Sung-bin ends up saving a local crime boss, Kim Tae-hoon from a brutal beating and gets a job from him. The next segment, Modern Man, intermixes fake documentary style interviews with a long fight between Kim Tae-hoon and Suk-hwan, an old friend of Sung-bin who was with him on the night that Sung-bin killed the man. Suk-hwan is now a police officer and his part of the interview tells about his job fighting crime while Kim Tae-hoon's interview segments show him speaking about his career in crime. The last, longest segment is titled Die Bad. Sung-bin is taking control of his own group after Kim Tae-hoon is taken to prison. Sung-bin recruits a gang of youths, including Suk-hwan's brother, to serve as knife fodder in largely meaningless fights. In the end, Suk-hwan confronts and kills Sung-bin, but his brother is also killed.\"},\n",

              "  'plot': 'When a battle between the Purple Dragons and what appear to be the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is captured on film, the Turtles are quick to refute their master Splinter\\'s accusations of carelessness. Breaking into the Purple Dragons\\' headquarters to get to the bottom of these mysterious doppelgängers, the Turtles discover that their \"impostors\" are, in fact, versions of them from another dimension. The other dimensional \"1987 Turtles\" prove to be too childish for the more serious-minded \"2003 Turtles\", but they are soon able to discern that they were teleported into their world in a dimensional portal accident that has also brought their arch-enemies, Shredder and Krang, and their battle fortress, the Technodrome, along with them. The eight Turtles head below the ground to track down the Technodrome, but their presence together only clues Shredder into the fact that there may be a version of himself on this world that he can ally with to take the Turtles down. The Technodrome escapes, and the Turtles, unable to track it, resolve to create a portal device of their own so they can travel to the \"1987 universe\" and obtain the gear the 1987 Turtles usually use to take the Technodrome down. While the Turtles are occupied with this task, Shredder uses the Technodrome\\'s technology to locate his dimensional counterpart, the Utrom known as Ch\\'rell, still in frozen exile on an ice asteroid after his final defeat by the 2003 Turtles. Ch\\'rell is teleported to the Technodrome, but upon recovering, immediately overthrows his bumbling other-self and seizes control of the fortress with the aid of his adopted daughter, Karai, who had been monitoring his movements and tracked him down after realizing he had escaped his frozen prison. Using Dimension X technology and Utrom science to create a new robotic exoskeleton for himself, Ch\\'rell dispatches his right-hand man Hun, who has been mutated into a monstrous mutant turtle himself after being doused with mutagen from the 1987 universe in the earlier battle, to track the Turtles down. With the aid of Bebop and Rocksteady, Hun finds and attacks the Turtles lair, but the eight reptiles complete their dimensional portal stick and escape to the 1987 universe. Unfortunately, Splinter is captured by Hun and brought before the Utrom Shredder to serve as bait in a trap. The 2003 Turtles meet the 1987 universe versions of April O\\'Neil and Splinter, and then return to the 2003 universe with the 1987 Turtles vehicles: the Party Wagon and Turtle Blimp. However, they discover that in their absence, the Utrom Shredder has fused the sciences of the Utroms and Dimension X and rebuilt the Technodrome as a truly terrifying war machine, filled with legions of improved robotic Foot Soldiers and mutated Purple Dragons. Entering the fortress to recover Splinter, the Turtles are defeated, and The Utrom Shredder then reveals his master plan: He has discovered while using 1987 Shredder\\'s to survey the multiverse in his plan to conquer it that there are not just the Turtles of the 1987 world and the 2003 world, but scores of them. Knowing that the turtles of those dimensions would stand in his way to conquer those worlds, 2003 Shredder decided to destroy them all by eliminating the original \"Prime\" universe. The Utrom Shredder scans the eight Turtles, each secured within an enormous spherical centrifuge-like device contained within the Technodrome, to locate the base similarities between them that will pinpoint the location of \"Turtle Prime\", and the brothers apparently do not survive the process. Once The Utrom Shredder has teleported the Technodrome away across the dimensions to Turtle Prime, however, the Turtles reappear, having been saved from oblivion by Karai, who has realized her father\\'s mad ambition would also spell their own destruction. With their world being erased around them as the Utrom Shredder\\'s plan goes into motion, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon headquarters again to appropriate some of the tech the criminals stole, in order to upgrade their dimensional portal stick and follow the Utrom Shredder to Turtle Prime. They\\'re attacked by Hun again, who\\'s still seeking revenge for his mutation. However, when he sees what\\'s happening to the world, Hun surrenders the tech just before he\\'s erased. The Turtles accomplish their task, and are whisked away to a grim and bleak monochrome realm from whence all Turtle realities sprang. They are attacked by the native 1984 \"Prime Turtles\", but they eventually manage to convince their ferocious progenitors to help them save all of creation. The twelve Turtles, with the aid of Splinter, Karai, and even the 1987 Shredder and Krang, engage the Utrom Shredder in battle, but he grows to massive height using molecular amplification technology from Dimension X and seems impervious to their attacks. When the Utrom Shredder is accidentally clipped by the energy beam from the Technodrome, however, his armor is damaged, and the Turtles all try to force him into the beam ... before it is abruptly cut off when Rocksteady trips over the power cable and unplugs it. The Utrom Shredder takes this opportunity to grab the 1984 Turtles and begins crushing them. The world begins to fade just as the 2003 world did, but The Utrom Shredder hesitates when he notices that he too is fading. Karai attempts to appeal to her father, telling him that what he\\'s trying to do will destroy them all, including him. But the Utrom Shredder has become too obsessed with revenge and decides he doesn\\'t care, and resumes his assault. At the last minute the 1987 Turtles throw explosive throwing stars at him, causing him to trip and drop the 1984 Turtles. The Utrom Shredder resumes his attack—until Bebop plugs the beam power cable back in and thus inadvertently obliterates the Utrom Shredder. With their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as their respective realities restore themselves. The 1987 characters take the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the 2003 characters use the portal stick to return to theirs. The 1984 Turtles decide to go get some pizza to eat ... as somewhere else, across time and space, Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman put the finishing touches on the first issue of Eastman and Laird\\'s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, expressing the hope that the book will sell.'},\n",

              "  'plot': \"As the audience is seated, the planetarium dome is suffused with a cool blue light, with a suggestion of clouds. The presenter walks to the center of the theater and flourishes a glowing ball about the size of a grapefruit, which he/she alternately lights and dims to accent a description of how various cultures interpreted celestial phenomena such as the cycle of day and night. At the conclusion of the introduction, the orb fades, the theater darkens, and the audience experiences a simulated sunset projected by the laser video system. As the sunset proceeds, the star projector rises to simulate the night sky. The lecturer asks the audience to imagine how mysterious the stars must have seemed to ancient people, and then demonstrates, using the star projector, how people invented constellations in an effort to make sense of the randomly scattered stars. In accelerated time, we see the complex motions of the sun, moon, and planets. The scene dissolves to ancient Alexandria, Egypt. We see the Great Library and the Pharos Lighthouse. In a courtyard, next to a pool surrounded by torches, we see the 2nd Century astronomer Claudius Ptolemy adjusting an armillary sphere to chart star positions. Behind Ptolemy is a small table on which rests a scroll. We approach the scroll and see that it depicts a geocentric model of the universe. Paintings on the scroll morph into 3D representations of the sun, earth, and planets, which hover above the scroll and rotate within a complex system of crystalline spheres, illustrating the earth-centered model of the universe that persisted until the Renaissance. The flame from a lamp pans across the field of view and dissolves to a candle flame burning above the workshop table of Galileo Galilei in Italy around the year 1610. We move into a courtyard where Galileo is observing with his telescope. On an easel lit by a lantern we see his sketches of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. These drawings also morph into 3D objects to demonstrate how Galileo's observations transformed our perception of the planets and helped establish the Copernican model of the solar system. The film transports the audience through a series of environments, such as Mount Wilson Observatory in the early 1920s, when Edwin Hubble discovered the true nature of the Andromeda Galaxy and the expansion of the universe. Over the desk of an anonymous modern researcher we see a representation of the Big Bang. The device of transforming raw data, such as sketches and photographs, into 3D objects is used to suggest how scientists must apply imagination to interpret their observations. Towards the end of the show, the audience experiences a simulated flight through clusters of galaxies, into the Milky Way Galaxy, our solar system, skimming the surface of Mars, where the probable and tragic loss of oceans beckon the audience to wonder about the future of our planet, and then finally returns to Earth, landing on the front lawn of Griffith Observatory. The presenter once again appears with the glowing ball and delivers an epilogue, reminding the audience that Earth and everything on it, including its inhabitants, was made from the clouds of dust and gas that lace the Milky Way; we are stardust, and the universe is our home.\"},\n",

Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a \"long coat of many colors\".Another possible translation is \"coat with long sleeves\" - see \"A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature\", 1903. ISBN 1-932443-20-7 Israel\\'s favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph\\'s bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun , the moon  and eleven stars  bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph\\'s words concerning these dreams.  They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade. Judah, the strongest, thought twice about killing Joseph and proposed that he be sold. The traders paid twenty pieces of silver for Joseph, and the brothers took Joseph\\'s coat back to Jacob, who assumed Joseph had been killed by wild animals.  The text of the biblical story is muddled over who sold Joseph into slavery - which of the brothers, Reuben or Judah, and whether he was sold to Midianite traders or Ishmaelite traders. What is clear is that Joseph was sold to serve Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh\\'s guard.{{bibleverse}}, {{bibleverse}} While serving in Potiphar\\'s household, Yahweh was with Joseph so that he prospered in everything he did. Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar and so he became his personal servant. Then Joseph was promoted to oversee Potiphar\\'s entire household as a superintendent. After some time, Potiphar\\'s wife began to desire Joseph and sought to have an affair with him. Despite her persistence, he refused to have sex with her for fear of sinning against God. After some days of begging for him, she grabbed him by his cloak, but he escaped from her leaving his garment behind. Angered by his running away from her, she took his garment and made a false claim against him by charging that he tried have sex with her. This resulted in Joseph being thrown into prison.Josephus claims that Potiphar basically fell for his wife\\'s crocodile tears even though he couldn\\'t believe that Joseph was capable of \"making sport\" of his wife. - Josephus. The Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, 4.1-5   The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners,{{bibleverse}} and soon afterward Pharaoh\\'s chief cup bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison.{{bibleverse}} They both had dreams, and they asked Joseph to help interpret them. The chief cup bearer had held a vine in his hand, with three branches that brought forth grapes; he took them to Pharoah and put them in his cup. The chief baker had three baskets of bread on his head, intended for Pharoah, but some birds came along and ate the bread. Joseph told them that within three days the chief cup bearer would be reinstated but the chief baker would be hanged.{{bibleverse}} Joseph requested the cup bearer to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release from prison,{{bibleverse}} but the cup bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.{{bibleverse}} After Joseph was in prison for two more years, Pharaoh had two dreams which disturbed him. He dreamt of seven lean cows which rose out of the river and devoured seven fat cows; and, of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. Pharaoh\\'s wise men were unable to interpret these dreams, but the chief cup bearer remembered Joseph and spoke of his skill to Pharaoh. Joseph was called for, and interpreted the dreams as foretelling that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine, and advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations \"from all over the earth\" came to Egypt to buy bread as this nation was the only Kingdom prepared for the seven year drought.  In the second year of famine,{{bibleverse}} Joseph\\'s half brothers were sent to Egypt, by their father Israel, to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him to be their brother Joseph. However, Joseph did recognize them and did not receive them kindly, rather he disguised himself and spoke to them in the Egyptian language using an interpreter. He did not speak at all to them in his native tongue, Hebrew.{{bibleverse}} After questioning them as to where they came from, he accused them of being spies. They pleaded with him that their only purpose was to buy grain for their family in the land of Canaan. After they mentioned that they had left a younger brother at home, the Vizier  demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This brother was Joseph\\'s blood brother, Benjamin. He placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. Joseph sent the brothers back with food but kept one brother, and the remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men.After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah\\'s persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution.Upon their return to Egypt, the brothers were afraid because of the returned money in their money sacks. Then when they get there Joseph reveals to them that he is in fact their brother, Joseph. Then has their father Jacob brought so they are all reunited in Egypt'},\n",

Most of the film is a reflection through her eyes, with Morgaine as narrator. In the beginning of the film, the Saxons are attempting to brutally invade Britain. It is noted that a strong king is needed to unite Pagans and Christians and defeat the Saxons before Avalon and Britain are lost. Morgaine is eight, living with her pagan mother Igraine and Christian father Gorlois. Igraine\\'s little sister, Morgause, lives with them too. One day, her oldest sister, Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, along with Merlin, comes to Igraine with a prophecy that she will bear the Pagan/Christian king who is destined to best the Saxons. Igraine is distressed after hearing that the child will not be Gorlois\\', and she refuses to bear the heir. Merlin expresses that the father of the great king would be wearing a dragon on his arm. Igraine doesn\\'t listen. Suddenly, little Morgaine has a vision, seeing her father dead. Viviane is pleased but concerned that Morgaine has \"the Sight.\" Soon, Igraine and Gorlois, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, are invited to a feast with the High King, who has called the feast to name his successor. In storms Uther Pendragon, a dashing and rugged man. Igraine is immediately drawn to him, and therefore Gorlois soon antagonizes Uther. However, as soon as Igraine sees Uther extend his arm, revealing the dragon of the prophecy, Igraine is flustered and leaves. Uther pursues her outside, where she is cold and unfeeling, trying to avoid any feelings. Uther expresses that he, as a Pagan, knew something bonded them before they even met. Gorlois interrupts the meeting, announcing out of jealousy that Uther was named the High King\\'s successor. Later, after Uther is crowned, Gorlois sets his army up outside of Uther\\'s camp to kill Uther. Viviane sends Igraine a vision and tells her she can still save Uther; Igraine sends her soul out to Uther and warns him just in time for his men to evacuate. A battle between Gorlois and Uther ensues, and Igraine faints. The next day, Morgaine sees her mother feverish and ill, and her aunt Morgause sends Morgaine to pick some herbs despite the manor being on lockdown on orders from Gorlois to protect Igraine and Morgaine. She is caught, but is released after a man in armor and Merlin approach the gates. A guard asks to see the masked man\\'s face, and Merlin puts a charm on the man to make him appear as Gorlois. At first, Morgaine is thankful her father is alive, but she noticed the dragon of the man\\'s arm and begins to understand that her \"father\" is Uther. Later, she is waiting for her father\\'s body to come home. Morgause says that \"Gorlois\" is upstairs sleeping with Igraine, but Morgaine tells Morgause that her father is dead. Gorlois\\' corpse then arrives, and Igraine is shell shocked. Uther emerges in his true form. Morgause, however, ignores the drama, as the man who delivered Gorlois\\' body, King Lot of Orkney, takes notice of her, and she falls in love. Uther takes Morgaine and Igraine to Camelot, where Igraine gives birth to Arthur Pendragon, the grand new heir of the prophecy.  Arthur and Morgaine grow up loving each other dearly. When Arthur is five and Morgaine is 13, Viviane and Merlin return, saying that it is time to take Arthur away for his training with Merlin as future king. Viviane then orders Morgaine to come with her to Avalon to be trained as a priestess. Igraine and Uther do not want Morgaine to go, but Viviane threatens to withdraw Avalon\\'s support of Uther, and Morgaine and Arthur are taken away from Camelot. Arthur and Morgaine are torn apart tearfully from each other, Arthur heading north with Merlin, and Morgaine heading south with Viviane. Viviane then takes Morgaine behind a misty curtain into a utopian island, Avalon. Viviane trains Morgaine to gain power of the elements, and in the servitiude of the Mother Goddess. It takes ten years for Morgaine to be initiated, her final test being to part the mists. Igraine has a distressful vision of Morgaine \"being taken.\" Soon after her initiation, Morgaine meets her cousin Lancelot , a handsome and bold warrior. He has come to seek his mother\\'s blessing in battle, but she is reluctant to give it. Morgaine shows him a stone circle, and she begins to fall in love with him. Lancelot sees through the misty veil a few Christian nuns and some virgin postulants walking down a path. One of them strays and seems as if she is aware of Avalon\\'s existence. Lancelot begs Morgaine to open the mists for her, and she does so. The postulant is startled, but quickly smitten with Lancelot, as Lancelot is with her. The girl\\'s name is Gwenhwyfar, daughter of a Welsh king. Morgaine immediately dislikes Gwenhwyfar, and closes the mists on her, separating them. Lancelot, annoyed, decides to defy his mother and leaves. A few days later, on Beltane, Viviane sends Morgaine to be a part of a fertility rite as \"The Virgin Huntress\", where Morgaine is to make love to the man who kills the king\\'s stag. Both partners are masked, so neither knows who the other is, but afterward, Morgaine longs for it to be Lancelot, but she knows she will never know for sure.  Arthur having completed his training with Merlin, finds his father, Uther, in a Saxon battle just before he dies. He is locked in a burning church and calls to both God and Goddess for help. Viviane, on behalf of the Goddess, answers, and gives Arthur Excalibur in exchange for loyalty to Avalon and paganism as well as Christianity. Arthur quickly agrees, and defeats the Saxons. Morgaine is finally released from Avalon and returns to Camelot for her brother\\'s coronation. She reunites first with Morgause, who is now Queen of Orkney and has a teenage son, Gawain. She then finds her mother, old and worn, sitting by a window with the Bishop Patrick. Igraine says that she is becoming a Christian nun and moving to Glastonbury. She says that she wants to seek repentance for betraying Gorlois long ago and being twice widowed. Morgaine is startled by this news and distressed. Meanwhile, Arthur has been given a Christian Princess as his bride. As Arthur introduces his bride to Lancelot, she is revealed to be Gwenhwyfar. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar are bewildered by this twist of fate, and have an awkward first meeting. Arthur then happily reunites with Morgaine. But soon, Arthur naively reveals that he was the King\\'s Stag at the Beltane feast. Morgaine, shocked that she\\'d made passionate love to her own brother, cries in despair and shame. In a brief scene, Morgause is seen performing an infertility curse on Gwenhwyfar, a woman \"she has decided to hate,\" cursing her to barrenness. Arthur is crowned king under the both Pendragon and Christian banners. The Bishop Patrick then weds him to Gwenhwyfar. Merlin and Viviane appear startled, this union seemingly unexpected even to them. Morgause whispers to her husband that Gwenhwyfar will never have children, making her son Gawain next in line to the throne. Morgaine feels sick and quickly leaves the celebration. Morgause follows her; Morgaine reveals that she is pregnant but does not mention that Arthur is the father. Morgause is surprised—Morgaine\\'s baby would inherit the crown before Gawain. Arthur is called away soon after his coronation, leaving Gwenhwyfar in Lancelot\\'s care. They go riding one day, only to be attacked by Saxons. Lancelot saves Gwenhwyfar from being raped, and they hide. Gwenhwyfar and Lancelot kiss, but vow that their loyalties are to Arthur first, not each other, and they swear to never have an affair.  Morgause concocts a potion to help Morgaine abort her pregnancy. Viviane stops Morgaine before she can drink it. Morgause warns Morgaine to never be Viviane\\'s pawn. Morgaine is furious with Viviane for letting this abomination happen: a bastard child fathered by her own brother. Viviane wants this baby to be Arthur\\'s heir, whose pagan roots would make him the greatest ruler Britain has ever seen. Morgaine renounces Viviane and Avalon, and moves to Orkney with Morgause. In the middle of winter, Morgaine gives birth to a son, Mordred. Morgause is advised by her husband, Lot, to kill the child. Indeed, Morgause has ample opportunity to kill him, as Morgaine is unconscious due to a fever she develops after childbirth. She sets Mordred in front of a cold open window. Morgaine suddenly calls out in her fever that Arthur is the father. Morgause gets a new idea and saves the baby and takes him to be nursed. She tells her husband that she will tutor and raise Mordred so the boy will have her influence. She even nurses Mordred for the first time herself.  This begins the second part of the miniseries. Morgaine, convinced by Morgause, decides to return to Camelot. Arthur has become the great king everyone has hoped for, and Gwenhwyfar is beginning to grow distressed at her inability to produce the son Arthur needs to succeed him. Arthur assures Gwenhwyfar that they are still young and have years to bear children. Morgaine returns to Camelot and is greeted by Arthur. She is introduced to Sir Accolon, a pagan Knight of the Round Table and son of the elderly pagan King Uriens of North Wales. Accolon and Morgaine are drawn to each other. Meanwhile, Lancelot is dealing with increased stress over Gwenhwyfar and his growing desire for her. Gwenhwyfar, obsessed with bearing children, resorts to asking Morgaine for a fertility charm. Morgaine obliges, and gives her the charm on the night of Beltane. On the night of Beltane, at a feast, Arthur gets very drunk. Meanwhile, Morgaine, feeling insulted by Arthur\\'s lewd remarks towards paganism, leaves the feast and rides out towards the field where the pagans light the Beltane fires and dance. Accolon follows her outside. Arthur, in the meantime, is taken to bed, barely awake, by a spirited Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar. Arthur then brings up how he notices Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar looking at each other, and how Gwenhwyfar has no child. Arthur, blaming the lack of an heir on himself, suggests that Gwenhwyfar sleep with both him and Lancelot in the hopes of conceiving the needed heir. Arthur emphasizes that Gwenhwyfar will be able to swear that the child was conceived in the king\\'s bed. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar are both skeptical, but Arthur persuades them, and they all bed down together. Meanwhile, Morgaine and Accolon kiss amongst the dancing pagans. The next day, Lancelot is feeling regret for what he has done with Gwenhwyfar and Arthur. Morgaine realizes that Lancelot will never love her, so she devises an alternative to Lancelot feeling regret and sadness all his life. Gwenhwyfar has, by this time, gotten her period, and therefore still remains barren. Her serving woman, Elaine, is ecstatic, as Lancelot  has asked her to marry him . Gwenhwyfar, angered and distressed, dismisses her. Gwenhwyfar is also annoyed at Morgaine, who promised the charm would work, and resents Arthur for insisting the threesome would work. At Lancelot and Elaine\\'s wedding, Morgaine speaks with Merlin. Viviane is absent from her son\\'s wedding, as the pagan banners of Pendragon have been taken down from Camelot due to Gwenhwyfar being hysterically upset with the \"painted savages.\" Meanwhile, King Uriens discusses taking a second wife  with Arthur, and out of spite, Gwenhwyfar suggests Morgaine. Arthur isn\\'t too keen on the idea, but he and Gwenhwyfar ask Morgaine. Gwenhwyfar carefully words the proposal, and Morgaine thinks it is Accolon proposing, and accepts. She only finds out too late that she was engaged to the father, and not the son. Morgaine decides that it would be for the best to go through with the marriage, as Wales was an important political ally. Merlin, upset by Morgaine leaving Camelot with Uriens, leaves the feast.  Merlin, upon returning to Avalon, dies of old age and tiredness, with Viviane horribly upset, and Avalon filling with mist. Morgaine, ironically, finds her marriage to Uriens to be the few happy years her life would bring her. Accolon becomes like a son to her, and for the first time in her life, she feels like part of a family. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Mordred, Morgaine\\'s son by Arthur, has grown to manhood. Viviane comes to him and tells him of his being next in line for the throne. Mordred takes this to heart and tells Morgause  he is going to claim his birthright. When he arrives in Camelot, Arthur is planning to turn back the Saxons, who have come on Britain again in force. Mordred makes himself known to Arthur only as his nephew, his mother being Morgaine. Arthur is not told Mordred is his son, and Mordred is welcomed with open arms into Camelot. King Uriens dies, and Morgaine decides to go back to Avalon. However, the mists will not open for her, and Morgaine believes the Goddess is dying. In despair, she crouches in the boat and lets herself float, only to be found by Igraine, still alive and living among the nuns. The women have a brief but happy reunion. Mordred and Arthur, overlooking the knights one day, begin a discussion about the next heir. Mordred insists Arthur should name someone, but Arthur still believes Gwenhwyfar might still bear a son. Mordred insists he choose someone before Arthur dies in battle. Arthur says he needs someone of his own descent. It is here that Mordred reveals himself as Arthur\\'s son and that Morgaine was the Virgin Huntress from long ago. Gwenhwyfar overhears this and runs away, embarrassed and despaired.  Gwenhwyfar has fallen frantically into praying all day before her dozens of religious icons. One day Lancelot meets her there, and they plan a secret rendezvous, only to have Mordred overhear. Mordred catches the pair before they sleep together, and he threatens to take both of them before the king and have them hanged for infidelity. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar escape, and they part for the last time. Gwenhwyfar enters Glastonbury, where Igraine meets her. Igraine takes her to Morgaine, still living there, and both women finally make amends with each other. Morgaine goes back to Camelot, now in ruins, with various men crucified, hanged and decapitated along the walls of the palace. Mordred, Morgaine, Viviane, and Morgause all meet on the stairs to the palace. Viviane reveals Morgause\\'s evil for all to see, reminding the people of the true ways of the Goddess; Morgause, in anger, takes a knife to kill Viviane, but Viviane quickly catches the knife and in turn, stabs Morgause first. Morgause falls dead. Mordred, having thought of Morgause as his real mother, takes his sword and kills Viviane. Because Viviane was Lady of the Lake, the sun is eclipsed, and Igraine senses her sisters are dead. Raven, a priestess who had taken a vow of silence, screams vocally for the first time in despair. A final battle then is set to take place between the Saxons and Arthur\\'s army. Lancelot joins him at the front lines just before the battle. Morgaine is off seeing over the cremation of Viviane and Morgause. Mordred has actually joined the Saxons and is leading them to Arthur. Morgaine sees this in a vision as the bodies of her aunts burn before her, and rides off to the battlefield. The fierce battle kills all until only Mordred and Arthur stand. Morgaine arrives all too late. She sees the bodies of Gawain, Accolon, and Lancelot among the thousands. Mordred and Arthur have both fatally wounded each other. Mordred dies first, in Morgaine\\'s arms, but Arthur lingers. Arthur begs Morgaine to take him to Avalon.  As in the beginning, Morgaine is in the boat. Arthur, barely alive, is lying in front of her; Morgaine tries to part the mists, but fails. Arthur holds out Excalibur, suggesting the Goddess needs an offering. Morgaine hurls the sword into the mist, where it is mystically transformed into a cross, and temporarily opens up the mists to Avalon. Arthur sees Avalon, and Morgaine declares, \"We\\'re home!\" Arthur sees the beautiful land, and then dies. As Arthur dies, the mists close permanently. Morgaine then goes to Glastonbury &mdash; not to live as a nun, but because she has nowhere else to go. She is convinced the Goddess is dead, until one day she sees a little girl praying at the feet of the Virgin Mary. Morgaine smiles, believing that the Goddess isn\\'t dead, but rather has reincarnated herself in the form of Mary, and perhaps there is hope to one day, generations later, bring Avalon back.'},\n",

With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed. Shortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days. These stories recall \"strange noises\" in the woods behind their house and dealings with an \"imaginary\" being whom Kerra had termed to be \"Kid Donni.\" One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew. Following the quake, Kerra is reunited with her \"imaginary\" childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon. The earthquake is revealed to have caused a \"rift\" in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world. As the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and Gadianton armiesto exit the past near the Whitman\\'s home. Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies.

Near the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large. The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies. Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier. A major Nephite-Gadianton battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding. Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored.

              "  'plot': \"Sultan Mahmud Shah, ruler of Malacca, dreams of a woman with unnatural beauty. Plagued by the dream, he asks the court magician their meaning. The court magician tells him that his dream is that of an extraordinary princess who lives on the peak of Mount Ledang. Sultan Mahmud becomes obsessed with the Puteri, and orders his Bendahara to cancel his scheduled wedding to a local princess. Sultan Mahmud’s officers and Dinda, the princess he had been engaged to, are confused with the Sultan’s sudden change of attitude. Dinda’s brother, Laksamana Zainol, is especially angry on his sister’s behalf. Zainol, propelled by his sister’s betrayal, begins talking to the Malaccan people of Sultan Mahmud’s foolishness, planting the seeds of rebellion. Sultan Mahmud commands the Bendahara to seek the Puteri of Gunung Ledang out, but he claims the task to be impossible. The elderly Hang Tuah, greatest of all Malaccan warriors, offers to find the princess for the Sultan. He forms a party of warriors and they set out to Mount Ledang to find her and present the Sultan’s proposal of marriage. They travel a great distance and have to overcome many obstacles. Hang Tuah himself becomes injured and is too weak to reach the peak, so he sends the younger members of the group onward without him. A single young warrior named Tun Mamat survives to reach the peak, where he is tempted by a flower fairy who tries to seduce him off his path. Tun Mamat repeatedly spurns the flower fairy and, upon beating her test, meets an elderly hag or Nenek Kebayan who agrees to help lead him to the peak of Mount Ledang. Once at the peak, the Nenek Kebayan leaves Tun Mamat, and he is greeted by four more flower fairies. They give him one final warning and then leave, making way for the Puteri herself to appear. The Puteri tells Tun Mamat that she has no desire to be queen, but she will marry Sultan Mahmud if he can give her seven presents as her dowry. Tun Mamat descends the mountain with the message, along the way reuniting with various members of the group who were lost or left behind on the way, including the recovering Hang Tuah. When Tun Mamat repeats the Puteri's message to him, Hang Tuah realises that the conditions are a rejection and he has failed in his task to the Sultan. He decides to leave Malacca forever in self-imposed exile. Tun Mamat and the rest of the warriors return to Malacca where the seven conditions are presented to Sultan Mahmud and the royal court, which are: * A golden bridge from the peak of Mount Ledang to the Malaccan palace, * A silver bridge from the Malaccan palace to the peak of Mount Ledang, * Seven trays of mosquitoes' hearts, * Seven trays of germs, * Seven jars of betel nut juice, * Seven jars of virgin's tears, * A bowl of Sultan Mahmud's son's blood. At hearing the conditions the royal court is in shock and dismay, but Sultan Mahmud is so focused on the beauty of the Puteri that he proudly claims that the seven conditions are easy and commands his people to fulfill them. All the gold and silver of the kingdom is taken from the Malaccan people to build the bridges; mosquitoes and germs are allowed to thrive, causing sickness throughout the land; all virgin women are forced to cry into bowls to collect their tears. At this time Zainol holds more secret meetings with the discontented people of Malacca to discuss Sultan Mahmud's inhumane commands. The people, now confident and angry, decide to strike at Sultan Mahmud for his injustice. During a second collection of gold and silver, a discontented man stands up to the royal collection officer and a fight ensues between the soldiers and the Malaccan commoners. This triggers more fights and skirmishes, sending the entire kingdom into turmoil. At long last six of the seven conditions are fulfilled. Sultan Mahmud is overjoyed but is cut short when the Bendahara reminds him that the seventh condition has not been done. Sultan Mahmud visits the sleeping chambers of his son, Tengku Ahmad, to strike him down with a keris but two nights in a row he is unable to go through with it. On the third night, Sultan Mahmud is ready to kill his son for good, but at the last minute throws his keris aside. Then the Puteri herself appears and says that she will never marry him because he is a cruel man. Sultan Mahmud realises the error of his ways and begs his son for forgiveness. The next morning Zainol and a large group of Malaccan people attack the palace. Sultan Mahmud decides to face them openly where he confesses his crimes and puts his life in their hands. All the people, including Zainol, accept his apology and pledge allegiance to him once again.\"},\n",

              "  'plot': \"The first scenes of the film take part in modern-day Havana, Chico, a shoe-shiner ends his day and goes up to his room that overlooks the port. He listens to the radio that plays a romantic arrangement of Bésame Mucho, which won a radio contest some 60 years back by performers Chico and Rita. The film then changes back to 1948 and finds Chico and his friend Ramón living as struggling dandies in a low-life bar where they are paired with two American tourists. The musicians at the bar play a ballad with their lead singer, Rita. Chico is immediately taken with her and he wishes to talk to her, but she is already busy with her own American tourist who will not let her leave. Chico and Ramón go to the Tropicana Club with their lady-friends, where they sneak in through the performer’s entrance. While walking around Chico stumbles upon Rita and her gentleman-friend almost initiating a fight but the Maitre d' overhears that Chico is an accomplished pianist and takes him backstage, since the main event of the evening is missing the pianist and he fills in playing at first sight a new piece by Igor Stravinsky. Chico, initially nervous, ends up performing the piece with aplomb, to the delight of the band. Rita finally agrees to flee with Chico in Ramón’s motorcycle along with the Americans, ditching her own John. After a dangerous chase, the American man finally crashes into a car dealership, giving the others plenty of time to escape. Rita and Chico take their leave from the rest of their party and go to a bar where Chico introduces her to bebop music, which she takes up very quickly; afterwards they go to Chico’s place and spend the rest of the night together. The next day Rita wakes up to find Chico playing a new composition on the piano, which he names “Rita”. As they play and kiss, Juana, Chico’s former girlfriend walks in and ends up in a fight with Rita after which both women leave angrily. Chico is taken with Rita and does not want to play in an upcoming contest if it not with Rita, so Ramón, who also is his agent, tracks Rita down and pays her to participate in the contest. After the performance is over, Rita leaves and Chico follows her in Ramón’s motorcycle. He sees that she enters a house where he believes that she lives with a man, but as it turns out it is the house of a santera that had predicted she would cause him much suffering. That night the contest winners are announced, and Pico and Chico win. The prize is a month’s engagement at the Hotel Nacional. A few weeks later, Chico and Rita are having great success during their performances and Rita’s beauty mesmerizes more than one man, which ignites Chico’s jealousy. One of the admirers, Ron, asks Rita to his table to discuss business. He offers to take Rita to New York City to make her a star, where jazz and Latin music are a burgeoning scene. While Ron tries to convince Rita to go to New York, she insists that the offer must include Chico, as well. Meanwhile, Chico has been watching from a distance and is extremely jealous, believing Rita wishes to leave him for Ron. Rita stands up to talk to Chico but he is already too drunk to understand and leaves in a rage. Even after this Rita insists that the offer should include both. Rita leaves and looks for Chico and goes to his place and waits in the courtyard where she falls asleep. She's awakened by the sound of Chico, completely drunk and barely able to walk, assisted by Juana. She leaves for New York alone as the new lover of Ron. Chico is depressed but he manages to get enough means to go to New York as well to find fortune. While there he finds Rita and manages to see her but she has become very successful and wishes not to see him again. Chico and Ramón deliver a letter of recommendation that they have received from Chano Pozo’s sister in Cuba which they hope will turn out to be a huge opportunity for them. Chano is receptive and excited to meet them; however, he is involved in drugs and has a short temper. After discovering that he was sold oregano instead of marijuana, Chano attacks his dealer only to be shot and killed by him a while later. In turn, Chico finds work as a party musician and Ramón as an usher at the Plaza Hotel. While at one of his gigs in a party, Chico runs into Rita again, who is flustered by the fact that a white woman has expressed her doubts about having a film made that features a black latino woman as a lead. Chico and Rita run away in her new car that she just got as a gift from Ron. The next day she leaves for California to film the movie. In the meantime Ron has located Ramón and proposes a deal to finance his artist-agency business, as long as he finds jobs to keep Chico away from Rita. Ramón complies with his end of the bargain and signs Chico with Dizzy Gillespie, who has a gig in Paris and then a European tour. All the while, Rita has become a big star and her film is a huge success. Chico has found a new girlfriend in Paris with a small dog; one morning, while playing “Rita” at the piano, the dog comes in and sits by Chico, who then changes the name of the song to “Lily”, the dog’s name. A few months pass on and Rita is sad despite all her wealth and success, since she is still mistreated socially due to her skin color. While being driven to a set and going through her lines, the radio plays a song she instantly recognizes and is moved to tears but is a bit disappointed to hear that the newest jazz-hit is known as “Lily”. Sometime later, while playing in a bar, Rita comes in and sees Chico playing “Lily”. After the performance is over and as Chico is ready to leave home, he comes across Rita, who asks him about this “Lily”, he teases her about the identity of the mystery female but finally reveals that the song is named after a dog. The two passionately kiss, which is caught in a photograph by a paparazzo, and agree to marry that New Year’s Eve after Rita’s debut in Las Vegas. Chico tells Ramón, who is alarmed that their union shall mean his own ruin and he slips in Chico’s coat a pack of drugs which are discovered during a police search during his own gig in Las Vegas. Chico is arrested and deported for Cuba, all the while Rita is waiting in her motel. She keeps drinking and when it is time for her performance, she denounces racism, virtually ending her career. When entering Cuba, Chico’s passport is held by the new Cuban revolutionary authorities and is forbidden to play jazz because it is capitalist music. Disappointed with life, Chico gives up music all together. Sixty years pass and while shining shoes for a tourist a young man rushes to Chico and tells him that some music big shots are asking very eagerly for him. He reluctantly agrees to go to the recording studio. For the first time in years he plays “Lily” and the singer asks him to join him recording that song which becomes a big hit and takes him in a world tour. After he ends his tour, Chico is allowed again into the United States and he searches for Rita, he finds Ron in a nursing home and discovers that his friend Ramón has died but no clues as to Rita’s whereabouts until he goes to Vegas, he knocks on Rita’s door, who has stayed for 47 years in the same motel room waiting for him.\"},\n",

However, the tyrant Sheikh Jafar, and his shadow of a magician, Burk, have other plans, in order to take over Oman's kingdom. After a lovely performance by Princess Zeila and her snake charmer friend Amin, a messenger attempts to give a proclamation, written by Oman's information minister, Tonko, to the princes from the three cities across the river.

He not only attended Princess Zeila's next performance at the palace; he applied the music for it.

Amin wishes to see his mother, but first, the genie takes them both to Jafar's palace to face Burk one last time. With Burk defeated, the messenger has returned to life, the magic ring disintegrated, and the ministers are old men again. The genie has also resurrected Calina, making Amin happy. Back at Oman's palace, Zeila admits that she loves Amin to Jafar, who is about to have his guard take Zeila as prisoner.

A class of teenagers from {{nihongo}} are kidnapped by the Japanese government. Instead of stereotypically studious Japanese students, these ninth graders are “a ragtag collection of delinquents and losers from all over Japan,” including tough-guy rugby players and punks with dyed hair. More importantly, many are orphans whose parents or family died in bombings by the Wild Seven. After their school bus is diverted to an army base, the students are herded into a cage, surrounded by armed guards, and confronted by their schoolteacher, Riki Takeuchi, who lays down the ground rules of the new Battle Royale game. Wild Seven is hiding out on a deserted island , and instead of being forced to kill each other, as in the old Battle Royale, the students are sent off to war and ordered to attack the terrorist group’s hideout en masse and kill Shuya within 72 hours. Most of the students are not interested in being forced to avenge their families, but are coerced to fight through exploding metal collars, which their captors can detonate by remote control. The teacher shows them a line in the caged class room: those who wish to participate are instructed to cross the line, while those who don\\'t will be killed. The students are put into \\'pairs\\'; if one student dies, then his or her partner will be killed via collar detonation . The students are sent via boats onto the dangerous island base of the Wild Seven, and a number of them are killed when they were bombed, shot or their collar detonated during the journey onto the island, leaving only a cluster alive. Most notably, two of the survivors are the main protagonist Takuma Aoi, and Shiori Kitano, the daughter of Kitano, the \"teacher\" from the first film who died after being shot by Shuya. Taken into the Wild Seven\\'s base, the surviving students\\' explosive collars are removed and they are encouraged to help the members of the Wild Seven stop the Battle Royale for good. While most of the survivors agree, Takuma and in particular Shiori remain unconvinced. Shuya sends a video message to the world of their goal to live free. In response to the video and pressure from the U.S. government, the Japanese prime minister takes command of the military present at the Battle Royale headquarters and orders an attack on the island base, with no survivors allowed. Takeuchi is enraged, and is discovered to have the same type of collar on his neck as the students. On Christmas Day, the war between the Wild Seven and the military occurs, with numerous casualties on both sides. Survivors of the base retreat to the mainland via a mine shaft, leaving Shuya, Takuma and Shiori as the only remaining fighters. Takeuchi appears in a rugby uniform, and after a brief and personal exchange, Takeuchi allows the group to flee as he sacrifices himself. Shiori is shot and dies in Shuya\\'s arms, seemingly forgiving him for his past crimes. Shuya and Takuma run out to kill the rest of the soldiers. Several months later, Shuya and Takuma rejoin the other survivors, including Noriko Nakagawa, in what appears to be Pakistan or Afghanistan.

              "  'plot': 'Crystal \"White Girl\" Van Meter is a 15-year-old prostitute who is sentenced to 25 years for a long list of crimes which include beating up and robbing johns. Transferred to a minimum security hospital to seek treatment for bulimia, White Girl teams up with Angela \"Cyclona\" Garcia, a teenage serial killer. Together, they escape from the hospital, despite White Girl injuring herself on a barbed-wire fence. Cyclona is convinced her beloved Sister Gomez can help \"White Girl\" with her eating disorder and they head to Tijuana. On the way, Cyclona murders a family and has sex with the dead bodies. \"White Girl\" is not happy that Cyclona has stopped taking her meds and insists she continue to take occasional doses should they continue together. They steal the family\\'s car and make their way south. On the way, Cyclona reveals how Sister Gomez saved her from being molested by her father and possibly aliens. After drinking one too many beers and huffing some paint, they crash and fall down a hill laughing. Undaunted, the two fugitives catch a ride on a freight train only to be assaulted by a transient crack addict. Cyclona kills him to protect White Girl, and the two make off with his bag of crack and guns. Venturing into the woods, they leave a trail of crack which is picked away by shady men with crow feathers on their hats. Lost and confused, they make it to the border only to have a stand-off with two customs officials, both of whom Cyclona kills. \"White Girl\" violently pistol-whips Cyclona and after making her point, the two race to the suburbs of Tijuana. In Tijuana, Crystal/White Girl makes money by luring men to dark alleys on the promise of a good time, and mugging them. Cyclona and White Girl check into a run-down motel where they have a moment with beer, a shower, a vibrating bed, and some rampant lesbian sex as White Girl finally gives into Cyclona\\'s sexual advances. After a few days, they find a poster that shows Sister Gomez is in town. Sister Gomez appears to be a Catholic/spiritualist healer; Cyclona is very keen that they visit her, for Sister Gomez has protected her from abuse in the past, and might be able to help them. They visit Sister Gomez at her gaudy mission house. Sister makes an enormous roast feast for her \"little movie star\"  and the friend \"with the hungry demon\" , referring to her bulimia. Cyclona then disappears as White Girl is forced to work for Sister Gomez in the same way as she has been doing, in exchange for food. Finally, Crystal grows weary and makes her way to the basement, where she finds small children in a bondage room with a U.F.O shaped lantern. There is blood everywhere. Cyclona is hanging half-nude in a bondage style contraption. She tells Crystal that Sister Gomez made her watch while she chopped up children and made food out of them. She reveals that her ultimate plan for Crystal was to fatten her up with the meat of the children, and then, serve Crystal up for dinner as well. Crystal concludes that Sister Gomez is the witch-leader of a bizarre cult that rapes and eats children and then sells the child porn videos, protected by the front of a Catholic mission. Ready to deliver justice, White Girl/Crystal frees Cyclona and kills all the cult members; she also reveals Sister Gomez to be a rather well-endowed man. Not succumbing to bullets, Gomez is thrown in the oven. Burning, Gomez screams of his 100,000 years of terror and the revenge from his father Jupiter that will ensue. Crystal, keeping a promise made earlier, is forced to kill Cyclona in a tearful scene rather than allow her to be captured. Cyclona, wishing to leave behind a life of abuse and violence, hopes to be reincarnated as an eagle . White Girl makes a deal with the federales and leaves with her lawyer/pimp, stating \"I\\'m not hungry anymore.\"'},\n",

With his childlike circus-performer girlfriend, he kidnaps a powerful executive whom he believes to be a top ranking extraterrestrial who can contact the prince of these aliens during the upcoming eclipse. After imprisoning the man in his basement workshop, he proceeds to torture the executive and slowly Byeong-gu\\'s true intentions are revealed. It seems that the executives company poisoned his mother in a pharmacy test, and though Byeong-gu does seem to believe that the executive is an alien, he\\'s deluding himself to his obvious act of revenge. When a detective comes calling to investigate the disappearance, the executive tries to escape but is thwarted by the psychotic Byeong-gu. The detective at first finds nothing unusual but on his way out sees Byeong-gu\\'s dog  gnawing on the bones of his master\\'s past victims. After contacting a partner in the police force he is killed by the psycho\\'s bees, is hacked up and fed to the dog. Byeong-gu then crucifies the executive and breaks his leg with his axe butt, to punish him for his attempted escape. In a desperate move, the executive convinces Byeong-gu that the bottle of benzene in his trunk is the antidote for his comatose mother. As Byeong-gu races to the hospital to deliver the antidote, the executive frees himself by pulling his hands through the nails. He then travels deeper into his captor’s lair, finding evidence of his grim research. Photos of mutilated corpses are littered with blood scrawled notebooks, while hands and brains of past ‘subjects’ reside in jars. Reading through the journals the executive discovers Byeong-gu\\'s traumatic past: his father was a coal miner who lost one of his arms due to his dangerous work and was killed by his wife when he attempted to attack her and his son. He was beaten in school and was a victim to the sadistic whims of his cruel teachers. He showed early signs of violence, such as stabbing a fellow school mate with a kitchen knife. His mother was then poisoned in the aforementioned incident and at a protest, his former girlfriend was beaten to death. He slowly went mad from the violence that surrounded him. At the same moment, the dead detective\\'s partner arrives and finds the frantic executive as Byeong-gu, after desperately rushing to the hospital, feeds the so-called antidote to his comatose mother, inadvertently killing her. Infuriated, he returns home with intention of killing the executive but finds the detective there. After a brief struggle and a bizarre turn of events, he captures both of them and plans on killing them both. The frantic executive then admits to being an alien and proceeds to spin an exotic tale which stretches back to the time of the dinosaurs, about how his race was trying to save humanity by experimenting on the genetic code of his mother. He also agrees to contact the alien prince at the executive\\'s company factory. Byeong-gu leaves the detective all his notes, saying that if he does not make it, he will have the responsibility of saving the planet. At the factory, the executive triggers a computer controlled robotic arm to kill Byeong-gu\\'s girlfriend, and after a long struggle, he beats his captor near to death. When the police arrive, they shoot Byeong-gu, and as he bleeds to death he wonders aloud, \"Now who will save the earth?\" In the end aliens do arrive and take the executive, who is in fact the alien prince himself, aboard their ship. After failing his mission, he deems Earth a failed experiment and blasts it from creation. As the credits roll a video recaps the entire journey of Byeong-gu\\'s life.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'A sequel in name only to a 2004 film , this film is about a teacher, named Aajaan Panor , who is humiliated by some students. She turns to black magic to exact revenge. The film begins with a man in a fishing boat, accidentally stabbing his finger on a fish hook. He is taken to see a mystic, who claims that the man is the victim of a Cambodian curse. He is tied to a chair and fish hooks start to emerge from under his skin as he screams. In sepia-toned flashbacks, we learn the story of six school chums who have a grudge: Ta, Kim, Por, Tair, Noot, and Ko. Ta\\'s mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta\\'s teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend . The boyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers , and Ko is their fun-loving friend. During their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por . Por subsequently discovers he\\'s not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta\\'s father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach . Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to \\'prove her infidelity\\' to Ta\\'s father. The six friends do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them. Seeking revenge, the students approach a monk who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the monk and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies via fish hook. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city. The story proper begins two years after these events. The six friends gather together after Ta\\'s father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor\\'s cottage on the river, Noot\\'s cell phone rings; her secret boyfriend wants to meet, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess , and Ta\\'s great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. Miss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents. At dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, Por spits up a fingernail. The group realises that the meat in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and eating the monk who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whomever is holding the camera. Tair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta\\'s father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta\\'s father, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can\\'t leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta\\'s father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangos. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta\\'s dead father. The group runs to the house\\'s dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of salamanders claw their way out of his body, killing him. The youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair  still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. She seems to see Kim as a walking corpse, and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes. Por finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. He fires the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por\\'s confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle. Miss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch. In the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot\\'s bag. Her cell phone rings—it\\'s her boyfriend, wondering where she is. In the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por\\'s head, the officers break in and shoot her. Kim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim\\'s room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta\\'s charred corpse. In horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly-burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim\\'s hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the monk was taken by Ta\\'s father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta\\'s great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta\\'s great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the monk that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane . It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta\\'s vengeful spirit had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her. A flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn\\'t court Kim within a week, she will \"offer\" Ta to her. Kim was then seen with the monk who appeared earlier, who warns her, \"Once you start, it will follow you till you die.\" She receives a clay doll and thanks the monk. Kim jumps out of the hospital window to her death, holding the clay doll. Ta\\'s burnt form lays beside her declaring his love for her.'},\n",

Pauline then gives the priest four letters, and tells him not to let anyone read them, and mail them right away, she then pulls out a box filled with voodoo dolls and dies. Flash to a hand lighting a black candle on top of a skull, as the credits fill the screen. It is now a couple days after Pauline's death, and Lorena, one of Pauline's great-grand children, is driving along the highway up the hill towards Skull Mountain. Phillipe, another great-grand child, is also driving to the house, and begins to annoy Lorena by honking at her, and eventually rear-ending her. She then pulls over, as he drives by, and sees the creepy house she is going to, and starts to have second thoughts. Phillipe continues on, only to see a skull appear and disappear in front of his car, after doing this a couple times, Phillipe almost crashes off the cliff and pulls over, only to have an irritated Lorena drive by him. Lorena arrives at the house and meets the priest, while Louette stands by the gravediggers who are about to bury Pauline, since her funeral ended an hour ago. As she stands watching, a raven drops the voodoo symbol of death, a string of beads tied at the end with feathers, onto the coffin in the ground. As Louette watches in horror, the beads start to bleed and then burst into flame, burning through the coffin, and causing thick smoke to fill the air, and Louette hurriedly tells the gravediggers to bury the coffin. Lorena finds out that Pauline has died, and has entitled her as part of the will, which wasn't mentioned in the letter. Thomas takes her things inside, and Lorena finds that Phillipe has arrived and is her cousin, and confronts him. She finds out that he is a horny, annoying twenty year old, and befriends him, despite his flaws and personality. Louette tells Thomas what she saw, and that she is scared, and Thomas just tells her it's her imagination, as she goes to take Lorena and Phillipe to their rooms. While doing this, Phillipe discovers Pauline's old elevator, and finds that it doesn't work. Meanwhile, another relative, Harriet Johnson is aboard a plane heading to the town, and sees a figure in a hooded robe, staring at her, and screams only to have it disappear and the other passengers give her weird looks. She finally arrives at the house, during the night, while it's storming. She is introduced to everyone, who are about to eat supper. The will reader arrives, but finds that he can't read it, for not all four of them are there, and says he will be back in one week. The three relatives then begin to discuss with Thomas why they're the only ones there. Thomas tells them that they never met Pauline, so she wanted them to come, and then describes why there is voodoo related material around the house, as Louette watches from behind a door. They are interrupted by a white, drenched man: the fourth relative, Dr. Andrew Cunninham. They introduce themselves, and Phillipe begins to call him out for being the only white relative, before they go and eat supper. After, Philippe begins to look around, and is scared by Thomas who is walking around the house. Philippe tells him he doesn't believe in voodoo and picks up a feathered bead, throwing it in Thomas' face, then going to get drunk. Lorena is inside her room, when a skull appears in her mirror, then her windows spring open and a robed skeleton appears, making her scream and run out into the hallway. She meets a drunken Philippe, who tries to kiss her, only to be sent away by Andrew, who comes to Lorena's rescue. Philippe then walks downstairs, and sees that the elevator door is open, and starts to go towards it, led by an imaginary Lorena. Thomas then begins a voodoo ritual with a needle and voodoo doll: as Philippe walks into the shaft, Thomas plunges the needle into the doll, and Philippe plunges to his death down the empty elevator shaft. Everyone is drawn to his screams, and Andrew goes down and finds Philippe's dead body along with the feathered beads. The sheriff is called and takes the body to perform an autopsy to see if alcohol was the factor or not, and forces the others to stay till he can figure it out. The next morning, Lorena and Andrew decide to go to into town to get away for a while, and begin to fall in love, while Harriet stays back at the house to help Thomas and Louette. After purchasing some plants, Andrew and Lorena are bombarded with a storm, and go back to the house. Harriet meanwhile, finds a creepy looking plant in the dining room, and discovers a snake inside, and then watches as it disappears! She quickly goes to her room, only to see the lock on Pauline's door fall off. She goes into the room and sees a voodoo shrine, and as she's looking at it, the rocking chair begins to move. She goes over to see who's there, and is bit on the arms by the rattlesnake sitting in the chair, falling unconscious. Andrew and Lorena find her and quickly take her to the doctor, while Thomas starts his ritual again, this time pulling out another voodoo doll. While Andrew is driving Lorena and Harriet, Harriet awakens and sees the hooded figure again. She starts to scream, only to die after Thomas stabs the needle into the second doll. Andrew is pulled over by the police who discover she is dead, and have them drive to the hospital, where they drop Harriet's body off. Then Andrew informs Lorena on the feathered beads he found at Philippe and Harriet's death, and decides to go back to figure it all out, taking a frightened Lorena with him. Andrew begins to read one of the many voodoo books in the house, while keeping watch of Lorena who is sleeping. Andrew begins to fall asleep, as Thomas once again performs a ritual, in which a snake slithers all over Lorena's sleeping body, until she awakens and faints. Then she is put into a trance, and gets up and leaves the room. Andrew awakens to discover Lorena is gone, and begins to look for her. He finds Louette downstairs, who leads him to the place where Lorena had gone: a passageway at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Andrew goes in and discovers Louette is gone, and enters a room filled with a bunch of people dancing to a voodoo ritual, all around Louette, who is now tied to a pole in the center of the room. During the ritual, a male dancer begins to dance around with a snake, and Thomas comes out with a knife slashing at Louette who is begging him to snap out of it. Then the male dancer starts to slash at Louette, and Thomas and the dancer take turns scaring her by slashing close to her face and stomach. Then Thomas takes the knife and stabs Louette in the chest, killing her. He then starts to dance and pulls Lorena out from the crowd to join in the ritual, only to have Andrew come in with a machete. Lorena starts to snap out of it, as Thomas magically makes a machete appear in his hand. The two men fight, while the dancer attacks Andrew. After knocking the dancer out, Andrew has his machete knocked out of his hands. As Thomas swings his machete at him, Andrew grabs the skull on a stick that the dancers were all worshiping, using it as a defense. Thomas splits it, and everyone screams. All the lights go out and Andrew finds he is the only one in the room and quickly goes to find Lorena, who is in Pauline's bed upstairs. All of sudden Thomas comes in, telling Andrew that Lorena is his and will do anything he wants, and makes her wake up. Andrew stops her from going closer to Thomas, and shakes her out of the trance, only to have Thomas start to perform a voodoo ritual to get Pauline to come out of her grave. Pauline's grave out back then starts on fire, and she rises from the dead, coming into the house and into the room to kill Andrew. However, Andrew read the voodoo book, and he puts a reversal spell on Pauline who then comes after Thomas. Thomas accidentally backs up, and falls through the window, crashing to his death on the fence. Pauline goes back to her grave, ending all the horror in the house. The next morning, Andrew asks Lorena to stay with him in the house, now that he's inherited it. She tells him she has to go, and he takes her to her car.\"},\n",

He stakes his reputation on his mathematical calculations that show Colossal should turn a profit. The bank sends Dodd to Hollywood as the new head of the studio. Colossal\\'s star actress, Thelma Cheri , eccentric foreign director Koslofski , and press agent Tom Potts  are conspiring with Nassau to sabotage the studio. They are deliberately running up costs on producer Douglas Quintain\\'s  jungle feature, Sex and Satan so that the film flops and the studio goes bankrupt.

To make ends meet, she smuggles money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie , a gun runner under the close watch of the ATF. Ordell learns that another of his workers, Beaumont Livingston , has been arrested. Fearing that Livingston will become an informant in order to avoid jail time, Ordell arranges for his bail with bondsman Max Cherry . Following his release, Ordell promptly lures Livingston out to be killed. Acting on information Livingston had indeed shared, ATF agent Ray Nicolette  and LAPD detective Mark Dargas intercept Jackie as she arrives in the United States with Ordell's cash and some cocaine that Brown was unaware was stashed in her bag. Initially refusing to deal with Nicolette and Dargas, she is sent to jail on possession of drugs with intent to sell. Sensing that Jackie may now be just as likely to inform as Livingston had been, Ordell goes back to Max to arrange her bail. Max arrives to pick her up and, only partly masking his attraction to her, offers to buy her a drink and help determine her legal options. Ordell later arrives at Jackie's house intending to murder her. She surprises him by pulling a gun she surreptitiously borrowed from Max's glove compartment, however, and barters a deal with Ordell whereby she will pretend to help the authorities while still managing to smuggle $500,000 of Ordell's money, enough to allow him to retire. To carry out this plan, Ordell employs Melanie Ralston , a woman he lives with, and Louis Gara , a friend and former cellmate. He also uses a naïve Southern girl, Sheronda. With Jackie's help, Nicolette and Dargas arrange a sting to catch Ordell, unaware that Jackie and Ordell plan to double-cross them by diverting the actual money before the authorities make an arrest. Unbeknownst to the others, Jackie plans to deceive all of them with the help of Max in order to keep the $500,000 for herself. After a trial run, during which Nicolette could observe the operation, the stage is set for the actual event. In a large shopping mall near Los Angeles, Jackie buys a new suit and enters a dressing room. Her role is to swap bags there with Melanie and Louis, supposedly passing off the $500,000 under Nicolette's nose. Instead, she gives Melanie only $50,000 and leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for Max to pick up. Jackie then feigns despair as she calls Nicolette and Dargas out from hiding and claims Melanie took all the money and ran. In the parking lot, Melanie annoys and mocks Louis until he loses his temper and shoots her. Ordell discovers that Louis has only $40,000 in the bag . Ordell realizes his money has been stolen and, also angered to learn that Louis shot Melanie, kills Louis. Ordell's next concern is the involvement of Max Cherry, having been told by Louis that he spotted Max in the store before the pickup. Lured back to Max's office, where Jackie is said to be frightened and waiting to hand over his money, Ordell arrives armed. Jackie yells out that Ordell has a gun and he is shot dead by Nicolette, who had been hiding in another room. In the clear with the law and in possession of the money, minus a 10% cut that Max has taken for himself, Jackie decides to leave the country and travel to Madrid, Spain. Jackie invites Max to leave with her, but he declines before Jackie kisses him goodbye and leaves.\"},\n",

His fit makes Doraemon angry and being a hot Japanese summer, he goes to \"cool off\" at the North Pole with the Anywhere Door. Nobita follows him there after he\\'s gone for a long time, and discovers a strange bowling ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons what looks like a giant robot´s foot. After sledding down the hill on it and having it crash into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls into his backyard. Doraemon, who returned covered in ice, thaws out and wakes up with a cold. When Nobita thanks him for summoning up the parts for a giant robot for him, Doraemon is astonished and admits that he knows nothing about them. However, using a combination of the Opposite World Entrance Oil and the Roll-Up Fishing Hole, they go to the \"World Inside the Mirror\"  and build the robot. Finally, Nobita dubs the robot \"Zanda Cross\", since he feels that the bowling ball that\\'s summoning the parts was a gift from Santa Claus at the North Pole. Using a brain-wave controller that Doraemon pulls out of his pocket, he and Nobita play around with the robot, making it do gymnastic moves over bridges and such. Not to keep things to himself, Nobita returns home and brings Shizuka back with him to play with the robot together, but Shizuka presses a button on the control panel that makes the robot fire a huge laser beam, resulting in the destruction of half of the city. Seeing this, they group realizes just how dangerous \"Zanda Cross\" really is, so they decide to return to the real world and forget about ever finding the robot. However, Nobita forgot about the bowling ball-like orb he brought back with him, which has been sending telepathic messages to a mysterious girl named Lilulu. She is the owner of Zanda Cross, and is looking to reclaim it. Following the orb\\'s messages, she seeks out Nobita, who accidentally lets slip that he knows about the robot. Lilulu proceeds to force him into showing her where it is, so Nobita borrows the Roll-Up Fishing Hole from the spare pocket Doraemon keeps in the closet and takes her to the World Inside the Mirror. She reclaims Zanda Cross, and asks Nobita if she can borrow the Roll-Up Fishing Hole for a while, to which Nobita agrees. After some time, Nobita is visibly nervous about what she is up to, and after seeing two shooting stars in a row, uses the Bamboo Copter to fly over and see what is going on. Flying over the forest by Mt. Ura, he discovers the Roll-Up Fishing Hole unrolled with a portal to the World Inside the Mirror open. When another \"shooting star\" falls from the sky directly into the portal, Nobita follows it into the other world and discovers that it is one of the parts for building a massive robot army and that Riruru is at the center of it all. Doraemon, who was suspicious of Nobita\\'s peculiar behavior at home and had followed him there, uses a long-range Paper Cup Phone to listen in on her, and discovers that Lilulu is actually a robot who hates all humans. Upon Lilulu discovering that she was being listened in on, she chases after Nobita and Doraemon. After returning to their own world, Zanda Cross, on Lilulu\\'s orders, tries to get through the portal as well, resulting in its destruction, seemingly separating the two worlds forever. The two have completely forgotten about the bowling ball orb that is still at home, however. It then wakes up, and starts bouncing around. So Doraemon pulls out a special kind of incubator and puts the bowling ball and Doraemon\\'s Translation Jelly in it, causing the bowling ball to speak. The ball reveals itself as the \\'brain\\' of Zanda Cross and he alerts Doaremon of a giant robot army who are involved in a plot to enslave all humanity, so that robot-kind can take over the Earth. Doraemon then reprograms Zanda Cross\\' brain so that the robot becomes their ally. Doraemon and Nobita alert their friends, Gian and Suneo, about the robot invasion, and they decide to lure the robot army into the mirror world instead, while Shizuka takes care of fixing Lilulu after she discovers her very badly damaged. Despite everything Nobita and the others did for her, Lilulu still flees from them and later proceeds to shoot Nobita with a laser beam from her finger when he confronts her. When she meets up with her superiors, Lilulu instead changes her mind and decides that she is not going to support their plan on enslaving mankind. Enraged, the commander of the robot army orders her chained up and locked away for treason. Nobita and Doraemon, who had been watching the whole thing, later rescue her from her captors. Despite having won back the trust of Doraemon and his friends, Lilulu confesses that she has an inner conflict with herself and doesn\\'t know what she wants, so she willingly lets Doraemon lock her up in a bird cage using the Small Light. In the meantime, the robot army gets further suspicious because of there being no humans in the world. They then discover that they are in a fake world upon analyzing the satellite image of the world and the same image of the current world and seeing how they are reversed. The robot army discovers the newly-made portal that Doraemon made to get out of the fake world and into the real world and heard towards there, leaving Nobita, Doraemon, Gian, Suneo, and Zanda Cross to fight together to stop the robot army from destroying the planet, while Shizuka, with Doraemon\\'s spare pocket, is left behind to watch over the tiny Lilulu. As the team is gearing up for battle, an outburst from Suneo\\'s robot  gives Shizuka an idea. She enlarges Lilulu with the Big Light, uses the Walk-In Mirror to go back to the real world, takes the Anywhere Door to Nobita\\'s room, and takes the Time Machine in Nobita\\'s desk drawer back to 30,000 years ago, when a Professor was creating two robots who would become the ancestors of the Robot Army. After learning from the girls on what has happened in the future, the Professor realizes that the cause is the Competition Instinct program he installed in the robots, so he proceeds to replace it with a program that allows robots to have feelings and love. However, he collapses of old age before the process is completed. Lilulu then takes over, despite being aware that doing so would result in her demise. The process is soon completed, causing the evil robot army from the future to disappear from existence. Lilulu herself disappears after shaking hands with a grieving Shizuka and declaring each other as \"friends\". Although not shown on screen, it is implied that Zanda Cross is erased as well, since he was originally built by the Robot Army. The group is saddened by the loss of their new friends, but a reborn Lilulu later appears before Nobita and smiles at him before flying off. The movie ends with Nobita rushing to tell his friends of Lilulu\\'s rebirth while Lilulu, no longer a machine of destruction, watches over the Earth from outer space.'},\n",

Leslie becomes frustrated by her fee and she and Jesse play a prank on Janice. A while later Janice pranks Jesse by pretending to fall over and accuses Jesse of tripping her over on purpose. Jesse is forced off the bus. Once Leslie\\'s parents finish writing their book, she and Jesse help paint their house. Jesse is impressed by her parents\\' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school on Friday, Leslie hears Janice Avery crying in the bathroom. After Leslie talks with her, she discovers that the reason why Janice is a bully is that she is abused by her father, and they become friends. Jesse and Leslie then take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school. They decide to go home when it starts raining and the creek gets higher than ever, and Jesse realizes that he has started having feelings for Leslie as she runs back to her house, for the last time. The next morning, Ms. Edmunds , Jesse\\'s music teacher, calls to invite him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jesse tries to ask his mother\\'s permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jesse does not ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jesse finds that his father and mother are worried sick because they did not know where he was. His father tells him that Leslie drowned in the creek after falling in  because the rope broke in the same morning when Jesse went to the museum. The family therefore thought that Jesse had drowned too. Jesse is heartbroken, and says he doesn\\'t believe that Leslie drowned. The following day, Jesse and his parents visit the Burke family home to pay their respects. Leslie\\'s father, Bill Burke , tells Jesse that she loved him, and thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jesse feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie\\'s death because he didn\\'t invite her to the museum trip and for not being there for her. He runs back into the forest, and breaks down in tears. His father tells him that it\\'s not his fault and says, \"She brought you something special when she came here, didn\\'t she? That\\'s what you hold on to. That\\'s how you keep her alive\". Jesse decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge with a sign saying \"Nothing Crushes Us\" across the creek to welcome a new ruler. He invites his sister May Belle to enter Terabithia; she is delighted because she was previously denied every opportunity to enter. She and Jesse bring back Terabithia in even greater splendor, with Jesse as king and his sister as princess.'},\n",

Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters like Frankenstein's Monster ([[Kevin James  and his wife Eunice , Murray the Mummy , Wayne and Wanda Werewolf , Griffin the Invisible Man , Bigfoot, Steve the Blob, and other monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis . However, Mavis prefers to explore the outside world with her father's permission, but the village he directs her to is actually an elaborate deception to convince her of the threat of humans enough to coax her back. However, this charade inadvertently attracts the attention of an ordinary young traveler named Jonathan  who was exploring the surrounding forest and followed the staff to the hotel. Once Jonathan enters the hotel, Dracula frantically attempts to hide him from the patrons such as disguising him as a Flesh Golem named Johnny-stein with the later hasty cover story of being a relative of one of Frank's body parts. Eventually, Jonathan is discovered by Mavis and company, forcing Dracula to claim he is going to arrange Mavis' birthday party with a young perspective. In doing so, Jonathan manages to charm everyone at the hotel, especially Mavis. Eventually, even Dracula begins to like the human taking him into his confidence about his family's traumatic past after the vampire notices the young man knows something about them in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, Chef Quasimodo Wilson  realizes Jonathan is human and captures him to cook him, forcing Dracula to directly intervene by magically paralyzing the chef. Eventually, the birthday party happens and it is a raucous success until Dracula freaks out when Mavis and Jonathan have an innocent kiss. A ranting Dracula accidentally lets it slip that he tricked Mavis at the fake village and Mavis is outraged at being manipulated by her own father. Things get worse when Chef Quasimodo breaks out of the spell and interrupts the party and reveals Jonathan's true nature. Even as the clientele are revolted, Mavis still accepts and expresses her desire to be with Jonathan even though he is human. For his part, Jonathan feels obliged to reject Mavis for her father's sake and leaves the hotel. Afterward, Dracula realizes that in his efforts to protect Mavis, he has broken her heart and now she tearfully wants to stay at the hotel forever. Wishing to undo his mistake, Dracula persuades his friends to help him find Jonathan and even risks his destruction by venturing out in the daylight to do so. Learning that Jonathan is about to board a flight out of Transylvania Airport shortly, they race on and enter a town en route. At that town, Dracula and company are stunned to see the humans having a 'Monster Festival'. To clear a path, Frankenstein tries to scare them, but finds the humans are cheerfully welcoming them instead and even provide a shaded route through the town for Dracula to proceed at maximum speed. However, Dracula finds that he is too late with Jonathan's plane taking off. With no alternative, Dracula desperately flies after it in broad daylight despite being hurt by the sun. With much effort, Dracula manages to reach the plane and resorts to mind-controlling one of the pilots  to apologize and tell Jonathan that he wants him to return to be with his daughter. Jonathan accepts Dracula's apology and Dracula manipulates the plane back to the airport. Later, Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, who tells her that she's his 'zing' and the reason why he had to reject her. Dracula gives his blessing to their relationship, Jonathan and Mavis kiss and the hotel has another party to celebrate his daughter's liberating coming of age before Jonathan and Mavis set off on their travels. The film ends with Dracula and his friends being shown in traditional animation  during the credits.\"},\n",

His bright but naive and idealistic son, Robert , works as a linguist at GCHQ a top secret British intelligence agency, using his love of Russian to listen to various pieces of communication on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The film opens on Remembrance Day in Whitehall, as the war veterans line up to walk past the Cenotaph, then moves back to a conversation between Jones and his son at Robert\\'s flat some months earlier, where Robert tells Jones that strange things are happening at GCHQ, and he\\'s planning on leaving and marrying an older woman called Cynthia  he\\'s fallen in love with. Robert says a Soviet mole was found, and that security is all over the place encouraging people to rat on each other. The higher ups seem convinced that if they don\\'t do something, their American friends in the CIA will stop working with them. Frank isn\\'t thrilled over the marriage plans, and he tells his son before he leaves that it\\'s unlikely anything off key can be happening in the agency. It\\'s obvious that Jones loves his son deeply and wants him to be happy, whatever he may choose for himself. The scene cuts to a room in British Intelligence, where operatives including Bruce ([[Gordon Jackson  are listening to a tape recording of the conversation between Jones and his son. A few days later, police report to Jones that Robert has died in a fall in an apparent suicide, and propose a verdict of accidental death is recorded. However, in the midst of his grief, Jones is puzzled by the circumstances of his son\\'s death and decides to use his old skills to conduct his own investigation, and approaches his friend Charles Greig ([[Barry Foster , who had joined MI6 after his service in the navy. Greig agrees to make discreet enquiries on his part. Returning to Robert\\'s flat, Jones is confronted by radical socialist journalist Bill Pickett  who had arranged to meet Robert to discuss the problems at British Intelligence, but Jones rejects his investigative approaches. Jones is also told that he is in the running for a large government contract for his firm, with an implicit undertone that he not make waves about his son\\'s death. The rest of the movie digs into an examination of the British establishment which is disturbing and ugly, and make Jones question his view of the country he loves. There are strong echoes of the Antony Blunt case and the Cambridge spies. Jones, discreetly pursued by British Intelligence, finds men who easily consider others expendable if their ideas of class and privilege are endangered. After Pickett is also killed in mysterious circumstances in a traffic accident, having found out the name of the man who Robert wished him to meet and before meeting Jones. Jones is then approached by Robert\\'s best friend and fellow British intelligence linguist Allen Goodburn  at Robert\\'s funeral. Jones gets from Goodburn that it was his good friend Grieg who had approached him as to Robert\\'s feelings for the service. Jones gets Grieg drunk and gets him to confess that he was at Robert\\'s flat the night Robert died. Grirg admits he was there as the service had something on him, but that his job was only to leave the door open and let \"others\" heavy hand Robert, not kill him. Leaving Grieg in his drunken stupor, Jones is picked up by British Intelligence and driven to a country house, where he is confronted by Secretary to the Cabinet  and Lord . They explain to him that his son was out of control, and was killed as part of a plan to mislead the Americans to the extent of the depth of Russian intelligence\\'s operatives inside British operations, in the hope that they could continue to gain intelligence from the CIA. They have presently left the higher Russian operative in place, until they can assess the extent of the damage caused. They advise Jones that should he go public with any of this information, he and/or Robert\\'s girlfriend Cynthia and her daughter will be killed or at least restrained. As a door to a further dining room opens, Jones notices Sir Adrian Chapple  and concludes him to be the higher level Russian operative. The film returns to the present, and Remembrance Day parade. Jones confronts Chapple at his home in Whitehall, and gets him to confess to being a spy for Russia. Jones asks Chapple to sign a full confession, which he does, but on approaching the desk where Chapple writes, Chapple points a gun at Jones. Jones turns the gun on Chapple, which goes off and kills Chapple—leaving his signed confession to act as a suicide note, and leave Jones in the clear. Jones returns to the Remembrance Day parade. The closing credits roll to an ambulance attending the death of Chapple, as Caine walks past the Cenotaph up Whitehall.'},\n",

Colby is upset because his prize calf has become sick for no apparent reason, and brings the animal to Hansen\\'s laboratory. Hansen examines the calf, which dies shortly afterward. Hansen tells Colby he cannot explain what made the animal so ill so quickly, but takes samples of the calf\\'s blood to a university lab in Flagstaff. A few days later, Diane Ashley , an arachnologist, arrives looking for Hansen. Ashley tells Hansen that the calf was killed by a massive dose of spider venom, which Hansen greets with skepticism. Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal\\'s carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby\\'s farm. Moments after they arrive, Colby\\'s wife, Birch , discovers their dog is dead. Ashley performs a quick chemical test on the dog\\'s carcass and concludes that like the calf, it died from a massive injection of spider venom. Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive \"spider hill\" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas. Ashley theorizes that the tarantulas are converging together due to the heavy use of pesticides, which are eradicating their natural food supply. In order to survive, the spiders are joining forces to attack and eat larger animals. Hansen and Ashley return to the Colby farm. As the scientists and the Colbys are walking past a barn, a bull stampedes out; it is being attacked by tarantulas. Ashley notes that the spiders likely will not be afraid to attack people either. Colby douses the spider hill with gasoline and lights it on fire, seemingly destroying the spider menace. However, many of the spiders escape out of a tunnel. Colby is attacked in his truck the next day, sending it over the side of a hill and killing him. Hansen happens upon the accident scene and helps the sheriff, Gene Smith , examine the wreckage. Colby\\'s body is found encased in a cocoon of spider webs. Meanwhile, Ashley is notified by her colleagues that a sample of venom from one of the spiders is five times more toxic than normal. Hansen is then told by the sheriff that several more spider hills have been located on Colby\\'s property. Hansen, Ashley and the sheriff examine the hills along with the mayor of Camp Verde , who orders the sheriff to spray the hills and the surrounding countryside with a pesticide. Ashley protests, arguing that pesticide use is what caused the problem to begin with and that the town would be better off using birds and rats  to eradicate them. The mayor dismisses the idea, fearing that having a large number of spiders and rats all over the countryside will scare away patrons of the annual county fair. A crop duster is enlisted to spray the pesticide. Once the pilot is airborne, he is attacked by tarantulas, and crashes the plane before he can disperse the spray. The spiders begin their assault on the local residents, killing Birch and Hansen\\'s sister-in-law, Terri . Hansen arrives at their home and rescues Terri\\'s daughter, Linda from the spiders. Hansen and Ashley take Linda to the Washburn Lodge. They consult with the sheriff, who tells them that the spiders are everywhere and Camp Verde cut off from the outside world. Smith drives into town, while Hansen and the other survivors at the lodge plan to load up an RV and escape. However, the spiders trap them in the lodge, and they barricade themselves inside. Meanwhile, Smith arrives in Camp Verde and finds the town under siege by the spiders. Smith tries to escape, but is killed when another car crashes into a support post under the town\\'s water tower, causing it to fall on his vehicle. Back at the lodge, the power goes out, and Hansen is forced to venture into the lodge\\'s basement to change a blown fuse. He succeeds, but is besieged by spiders who break through one of the basement windows, by using their combined weight. He makes it upstairs just in time to be saved by Ashley. The film concludes the next day, with the survivors rigging up a radio receiver and listening for news of the attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn\\'t mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened. Hansen pries off the boards from one of the lodge\\'s windows, and discovers that the entire building is encased in a giant web cocoon. The camera pulls back, and all of Camp Verde is encased in cocoons as well.'},\n",

Karin\\'s husband Martin  tells her father, David, that Karin\\'s disease is almost incurable. Meanwhile, Minus , Karin\\'s 17-year-old brother, tells Karin that he wishes he could have a real conversation with his father, and cries because he feels deprived of his father\\'s affection. David  is a novelist suffering from a \"writer\\'s block\" who has just returned from a long trip abroad. He announces he will leave again in a month, though he promised he would stay. The others are upset, and David gives them unthoughtful, last-minute presents. He leaves them and sobs alone for a moment. When he returns, the others cheerfully announce that they too have a \"surprise\" for David; they perform a play for him that Minus has written. David takes offense  at the play, which can be interpreted as an attack on his character. That night, after rejecting Martin’s erotic overtures, Karin wakes up and follows the sound of a foghorn to the attic. She faints after an episode in which she hears voices behind the peeling wallpaper. David, meanwhile, has stayed up all night working on his manuscript. Karin enters his room and tells him she can\\'t sleep, and David tucks her in. Minus asks David to come with him out of the house, and David leaves. Karin looks through David\\'s desk and finds his diary, learning that her disease is incurable and that her father has a callous hunger to record the details of her deterioration. The following morning, David and Martin, while fishing, confront each other over Karin. Martin accuses David of sacrificing his daughter for his art, and of being a self-absorbed, callous, cowardly phony. David is evasive, but admits that much of what Martin says is true. David says that he recently tried to kill himself by driving over a cliff, but was saved by a faulty transmission. He says that after that, he discovered that he loves Karin, Minus and Martin, and this gives him hope. Meanwhile, Karin tells Minus about her episodes, and that she is waiting for God to appear behind the wallpaper in the attic. Minus is somewhat sexually frustrated, and Karin teases him, even more so after she discovers that he hides a men\\'s magazine. Later, on the beach, when Karin sees that a storm is coming, she runs into a wrecked ship and huddles in fear. Minus goes to her and she grabs him. Though the act is not shown the film suggests that Karin has sexually seduced her brother. Minus tells the other men about the incident in the ship and Martin calls for an ambulance. Karin asks to speak with her father alone. She confesses her misconduct toward Martin and Minus, saying that a voice told her to act that way and also to search David\\'s desk. She tells David she would like to remain at the hospital, because she cannot go back and forth between two realities — she must choose one. While they are packing to go to the hospital, she runs to the attic, where Martin and David observe her actions. She says that God is about to walk out of the closet door, and asks her husband to allow her to enjoy the moment. The ambulance, a helicopter, flies by the window, making a lot of noise and shaking the door open. Karin moves toward the door eagerly, but then she runs from it, terrified, and goes into a frenzy of panic. Karin vanishes, and, reappearing in a frenzy, is sedated. When she stands, she tells them of God: an evil-faced spider who tried to penetrate her. She looked into God\\'s eyes, and they were \"cold and calm,\" and when God failed to penetrate her he retreated onto the wall. \"I have seen God,\" she announces. Karin and Martin leave in the helicopter. Minus tells his father that he is afraid, because when Karin had grabbed him in the ship, he began leaving ordinary reality. He asks his father if he can survive that way. David tells him he can if he has \"something to hold on to.\" He tells Minus of his own hope: love. David and his son discuss the concept of love as it relates to God, and the factor of human father-child relationships in the perception of God, in the stretching final chapter of the film. Minus seems relieved, and is tearfully happy that he finally had a real conversation with his father: \"Father spoke to me.\"'},\n",

Angry that Collins has overshadowed him, de Valera announces that he will travel to the United States to seek recognition from Woodrow Wilson, and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins informs Boland that de Valera fears leaving them alone together. After returning, de Valera decrees that the IRA must attack The Custom House. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Irish Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only hold out for a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his shock, however, the British soon call for a cease fire. Collins is ordered to London to participate in negotiations with the British, despite objecting that he is not a diplomat. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, de Valera erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Collins argues that the Treaty gives them the freedom to achieve the Republic. De Valera and his supporters resign in protest after the Dáil approves the Treaty by 64-57. Both Collins and de Valera try to sway the Irish people in their respective directions. Collins is attacked by an anti-Treaty Republican during a rally, but escapes. In the aftermath, he asks Kitty Kiernan to marry him and she accepts. When the people vote to approve the Treaty, de Valera refuses to accept the results and orders the IRA to seize the Four Courts in Dublin. Ordered by the Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins is appalled at having to fight former comrades. Arthur Griffith, however, informs him that, if the Irish Free State Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins\\' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the Liffey. Devastated by Boland\\'s death, Collins travels to County Cork. He reaches out to de Valera through an intermediary, asking for a peace conference. Without de Valera\\'s knowledge, the intermediary informs Collins that de Valera will meet him at Béal na Bláth the following day. As a convoy of Irish Army vehicles approaches, IRA men open fire from a nearby hillside. Collins is shot and killed. Kitty is informed of his death just after trying on her wedding gown. Completing his story, O\\'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has. The film ends with a montage of footage from Collins\\' funeral. A eulogy states that, although a career soldier, Collins died in a failed effort to remove the gun from Irish politics.'},\n",

After Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he\\'s stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm\\'s accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm. Martin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier\\'s daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank. While Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette.

Barnier tries to persuade his masseur to marry his daughter Colette, promising to give him the suitcase full of jewelry as a wedding present. Barnier almost has a heart attack when he opens the suitcase and finds clothes inside instead of jewels. At this point, Martin comes back and tells Barnier that before he had gone to the bank, while they were discussing giving the jewelry to Colette as a wedding present, he had hidden a piece of paper among the documents. When Barnier had signed an agreement to give Colette the jewelry, he had also signed a document giving Martin banking power of attorney.

She had attacked her boyfriend too, who, though injured, managed to live on. She was rushed to the hospital, where just before dying, her facial look and voice changed completely for a short while, thus confusing all the attending doctors. Professor Agni Swaroop , who is supposedly an expert in phenomena involving the unexplained and the supernatural is called by the police to look into the matter and declares that the girl was killed by an evil spirit that has been awakened by her entering the forest. The story then turns to Sanjana Dhanraj  and Aditya Dhanraj  in Mumbai in a business party, where Aditya seems too busy to pay heed to the fact that his wife is longing to talk to him. She snatches the car keys from Aditya's pocket and leaves the party to return home. On her frantic drive home, she hears a voice in her head and loses control of the car. However, miraculously, she escapes the accident unscathed. After her recovery, Sanjana asks her husband for a divorce; Aditya, however, realizes his fault and suggests a vacation to work out their problems. He offers Sanjana a trip to any corner of the world for some days and Sanjana chooses to return to Ooty  in order to save their failing marriage. In Ooty they stay in the same bungalow behind which Nisha was attacked. Initially, the couple enjoy their stay at the cottage but soon Sanjana starts experiencing mysterious things, such as hearing a woman screaming in the forest behind the cottage and inexplicable falling objects. She later learns that their housekeeper's husband, Robert, also used to hear strange voices from the forest, and that he ran from the house in fear once he could bear it no more. She shares her problems with her friend Priya , a local girl, who advises Sanjana to visit professor Swaroop. The professor arrives at the cottage and after a short investigation announces the presence of a spirit in the house. He also tells Sanjana about the earlier incident involving the girl who was attacked and killed by an evil spirit in those very woods. He then re-visits the same spot in the forest where Nisha was attacked. He was accompanied by Priya and Sanjana too. Sanjana goes alone to talk to that spirit, where after some time, she discovers a revolver. All three of them go to an arms store to learn more and are told by the shopkeeper that the revolver was licensed to a retired colonel named Col. Arjun Malik. They visit the colonel's house, suspecting him to be a murderer of innocent girls, but soon learn from the colonel that the spirit is actually his own daughter, Malini , who was mentally ill and had managed to escape from the mental asylum several times. Using the methodology suggested by the professor, Sanjana summons the spirit, believing that the spirit wants to tell her something. The spirit conveys that Malini had met Aditya when he came to Ooty the previous year for work. When Sanjana confronts Aditya, he admits that he had stayed at the same cottage where Sanjana and Aditya were currently staying. They eventually learn that that Malini and Aditya had an affair and that Aditya rebuked Malini's demands that he leave his wife, claiming that the affair was never meant to be anything more than physical. An enraged Malini commits suicide in front of Aditya inside of his home. Aditya, with the help of his then manservant Robert, buried the dead girl's body in the forest behind the cottage. Sanjana storms off in anger leaving Aditya alone. The professor tells Sanjana that all this was an attempt by Malini's spirit to separate Sanjana and Aditya in order to take him with her into the afterlife. He believes that the spirit's next step would be to kill Aditya and that they should rush to Aditya before Malini attacks him. Sanjana goes to Aditya and tells him that she is doing this just to save him and that they should leave for Mumbai in their car immediately. After they leave, Sanjana, Priya and the Prof Swaroop arrive at the cottage where the bewildered maid tells them that Aditya just left with her. Prof Swaroop realizes that the earlier Sanjana was Malini's spirit in disguise and they rush after the car. Malini's spirit meanwhile causes the car in which Aditya is travelling to fall off a cliff. Aditya goes into a coma and is hospitalised. To prevent the spirit from succeeding in her plans, Sanjana, Priya and the professor go into the forest to locate the girl's body to burn it. The professor is killed by the spirit and then possessed by her and attacks Sanjana during this episode, where Sanjana also discovers the dead body of the husband of the maid who first told Sanjana about the strange voices. At the last moment, Sanjana manages to burn the body, thereby liberating the girl's spirit and saving Aditya's life. The film ends with Aditya and Sanjana reuniting.\"},\n",

She impulsively visits her sister Eleanor ([[Jane Adams , who runs a struggling rural school in Appalachia. There, she discovers a treasure trove of traditional English ballads, which have been preserved by the secluded mountain people since the colonial period of the 1600s and 1700s. Lily decides to record and transcribe the songs and share them with the outside world. With the help of a musically talented orphan named Deladis Slocumb , Lily ventures into isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs. She finds herself increasingly enchanted, not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harsh conditions. She becomes privy to their struggles to save their land from Earl Giddens , representative of a coal mining company. At the same time, Lily is troubled when she finds that Eleanor is engaged in a lesbian love affair with her co-teacher at the school. Lily meets Tom Bledsoe , a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician. Despite some initial resentment, she soon begins a love affair with him. She experiences a slow change in both her perception of the mountain people as savage and uncouth, and of her sister\\'s sexuality as immoral. Hoping to help share the culture of the mountain people with the wider world, Lily convinces Clementine McFarland , an art collector, to purchase a painting done by a local woman. Events come to a crisis when a young man discovers Eleanor and her lover, Harriet, kissing in the woods. That night, two men set fire to the school building, burning Eleanor, Harriet, and Deladis out of their home and destroying Lily\\'s transcriptions of the ballads and her phonograph recordings. Rather than starting over again, Lily decides to leave. But she convinces Tom and Deladis to \"go down the mountain\" with her to make and sell phonograph recordings of mountain music. As they depart, Cyrus Whittle, a renowned professor from England, arrives on a collection foray of his own, ensuring that the ballads will be preserved in the manner that Lily had originally intended.'},\n",

Taking us through a day in Ian and Sam's life, the film opens by showing different events such as Sam getting burnt on a kettle, Ian's watch breaking, Sam getting Coca-Cola spilt on her and Ian being interrupted by Sam during an important meeting at work.  As the day progresses we see Ian in a taxi. He tells the driver  about how he and Sam are going through difficulties. The driver recommends he should just love her. After Sam's concert that night, Ian tries to dismiss Sam's favorite student. At dinner Sam confronts Ian where her frustration boils over. She gets angry at Ian for his attitude toward her and tells him that she just wants him to love her. Sam storms out of the restaurant in tears, Ian following close behind and asking for her forgiveness. Sam gets in a passing taxi and as Ian tries to get in beside her he notices that the driver is the same man who he traveled with earlier that day. The man gives Ian an ominous smile and as the clock hits 11 PM, Sam closes the door, leaving Ian standing there. As he watches the taxi drive away, Ian makes one last attempt to reconcile with Sam and runs after the taxi as it stops at a traffic light. Before he gets there, the lights change and the taxi begins driving again. As it speeds up, the taxi is struck violently by another car and comes to a stop on the middle of the street. Ian halts and falls on his knees in shock. At a nearby hospital, Sam is being taken into the ER and Ian is running through the hospital looking for her. He arrives outside the room where Sam was and through a windows sees her wounded and surrounded by medical personnel. Sam looks over to the window towards Ian, a blank expression on her face. Ian begins to cry and before the doctors can help her, Sam succumbs to her injuries and dies. Ian falls to the floor in the hospital in disbelief. We see Sam's friend Lottie  enter a hospital room, where Ian is sitting in a chair. They both begin to cry. Ian goes back to his apartment, finds Sam's notebook and opens it, finding a song she was working on. He falls asleep clutching the notebook close to him. As the next day begins, Ian wakes up with the notebook still held tight. He is shocked to hear a voice behind him tell him not to read a word. He jumps up and screams, only to see Sam standing in his apartment. After the initial confusion, Ian comes to the conclusion that the previous day must have been a dream and continues the morning, happy to have Sam by his side As the morning progresses however, Sam gets burnt by her hair straighteners in the same place she had been burnt by the kettle in his supposed dream. Able to shake this off as a sheer coincidence, Ian takes no further notice of it. Other events similar to those he already experienced begin happening too, although at different times and in different ways, as Sam gets Coca-Cola spilt on her. This time Ian mentions his dream to her, and she convinces him that it was just a dream, and if his watch remains in working order then it can't possibly be the same day as his dream. Nonetheless, Ian is still cautious, and while in a meeting at work he holds his folder in his hands. Sam sees this from outside the glass doors and his meeting is left uninterrupted. Later in the day, Ian gets into a taxi. After talking to the taxi driver he realizes that the driver is the man from the previous day. He questions the man about this and the driver says he does not remember, although he once again gives Ian an ominous smile, implying he may in fact know about Sam's accident and all the previous events. This convinces Ian once and for all, and he runs to Sam, who's helping her friend Lottie set up for an art gallery. After convincing her to come with him, he brings her to a train station. After much questioning Sam reveals they are traveling to Ian's rural home town. A delighted Sam makes sure that she'll be back in time for her concert, which Ian ensures they will be. Ian brings Sam up a mountain, to a spot he used to visit as a child. The two find a little abandoned cottage on the mountainside to use as shelter during a rain storm. Upon setting up a fire while Sam sits down, Ian notices that his watch is cracked and isn't working. He turns to look at Sam, who's lighting candles on a table. Sam smiles and when Ian asks what she would do if she didn't have a lot of time left, she replies that she'd do what she's doing right now; spending time with him, just being together. Ian and Sam begin kissing, before making love. Afterwards, they make their way back down the mountain, disappointed that they never made it to Ian's spot. In the town below, the two have drinks and Ian tells Sam about his father, who lost his beloved job in 1993 before becoming an alcoholic and dying sometime later. Ian reveals that he wishes he could have helped his father more, but Sam says he was only a child at the time and wherever his father is now, he's proud of him. The two travel back to London and Ian takes Sam on the London Eye as another surprise. They then travel back to their apartment and while Sam is distracted, Ian takes a page from her notebook and brings it to a nearby photocopying shop while Sam travels to her concert with her violin. Before the show begins Ian sends a bouquet of flowers up to Sam and gives the photocopied pages to an organizer. A puzzled Sam looks out to Ian in the crowd when her bouquet arrives. His plan is soon revealed however when Ian comes onto center-stage with a microphone. He calls a reluctant Sam to his side, who gets nervous. Ian goes and talks to Sam at her seat and tells her she doesn't want to disappoint her future fans. Sam proceeds onto the stage as the orchestra begins to play the song printed on Ian's photocopied sheets. She sings the song she wrote for Ian in her notebook and the crowd burst into applause at her performance. While walking to a restaurant of Sam's choice, she describes her feelings to Ian. In an intimate surrounding, Sam and Ian discuss the day in a sheer contrast to Ian's experience the previous night. Ian gives Samantha a charm bracelet with different charms and symbols: a musical note, a violin, a flower , the train they took that day and the Eiffel Tower, which Sam had always wanted to see. The two sit in silence as Sam tears up and smiles across at Ian. As they leave the restaurant in a downpour, Sam tries to get a taxi to take them home. Ian realizes they are in the same spot as the previous night when the accident took place and tells her to look at him and listen. In the rain, Sam listens as Ian professes his love for her and tells her that if it weren't for her or today, he would never have known true love at all. Sam begins crying and says she doesn't know what to say, to which he replies that she doesn't need to say anything. A taxi pulls up and Sam gets in, beckoning Ian to get in too. He gets in next to her. As the taxi approaches the traffic lights, Ian and Sam kiss. He looks forward and sees the clock strike 11 PM and the same ominous smile he has seen so many times already. Sam smiles at him as the taxi pulls away and images of Sam's accident flash through his mind. He sees a car light through his window and grabs Sam tight for the last time. Sam's scream can be heard. At the hospital, we see Sam's friend Lottie run through the halls. She turns a corner and enters a hospital room, where Sam is sitting in a bed. Sam tells Lottie about Ian's premonition and how she didn't believe him. She and Lottie begin to cry. In the end it was Ian who was the victim of the accident. Six months later, Sam is sitting in the apartment, with Ian's watch in her hands. Everything is packed into boxes and Sam takes a last look at the room. We see her singing on stage in a restaurant, with Lottie sitting at the closest table to her. She travels to the cottage on the mountain which she and Ian visited and continues climbing until she reaches Ian's spot at the peak of the mountain. She stands at the top, staring out into a valley, not knowing what lies ahead.\"},\n",

Miguel has just been appointed the new governor of Nuova Aragon after the death of his uncle, Don Fernando. Diego tries to warn Miguel that Nuova Aragon has been ruled by greed and hatred for many generations and that Miguel\\'s uncle  was probably murdered, but Miguel, who is consumed by pacifistic humanitarian ideals, will not listen. Later that same evening, Miguel is attacked by several men while walking outside the inn. Diego arrives and, with stunning swordplay, defeats the men and forces one of them to talk. The man says that Colonel Huerta  sent them to kill Miguel. Dying, Miguel agrees to let Diego go in his place, but makes him swear that \"the new Governor will never kill.\" Diego reluctantly agrees. Months later in Nuova Aragon, Colonel Huerta asks the council for complete control of the army and government. Just then, Diego  arrives and announces that he is the new governor. He then meets Miguel\\'s aunt, Carmen , who is little inclined to have any kind of familial relationship with her \"nephew\". He also meets Kapitan Fritz von Markel , the head of the Governor\\'s personal guard, and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt via a bowl of poisoned sweets . Diego and Joaquin  watch Huerta force his men through a grueling fencing practice; afterwards, Huerta slices through candles without disturbing them, showing off his skill. In response to the Governor\\'s request for \"personal safety\", he appoints Sergeant Garcia , an overweight soldier with more than a bit of an appetite, as the Governor\\'s bodyguard. Later, in Diego\\'s room, the dog Assassin shows Diego and Joaquin a secret passageway behind a bookshelf. In disguise, Diego and Joaquin roam the streets of Nuova Aragon, seeing how much the people have been cowed. Two incidents attract Diego\\'s attention: a group of boys causing mischief to corrupt merchants leaving behind a chalked \"Z\", and a monk named Brother Francisco trying to rouse the people against Huerta\\'s cruelty. After the monk is helped to evade capture by the soldiers by friendly townspeople, Diego and Joaquin question one of the boys, Chico. Although unwilling to talk at first, Chico is convinced to trust Diego and tells him about the legend of Zorro: \"the spirit of the black fox. He\\'s a great fighter and he always wins, he can never die.\" Bringing Brother Francisco\\'s cart back to him, Diego, Joaquin and Chico witness Brother Francisco being arrested by the soldiers. The next day, Brother Francisco has been unjustly sentenced to 20 lashes for fraud in selling rotten hides and slander against the merchant who has framed him. After a few lashes, Diego appears as Zorro, releases Brother Francisco and forces the soldiers to give \"the corrupt judge, the lying witness, and the murdering executioner\" three times the number of lashes Brother Francisco was sentenced to. Diego, once again as Serna, comments on a portrait of Hortensia Pulido  and is attracted to her. He is informed by Aunt Carmen that her family was once wealthy but now poor, a fact confirmed by Huerta who claims that the Pulidos were conspiring against the people of Nuova Aragon. Later in the town marketplace, Hortensia urges the people to rise up against the soldiers, saying that the scales the merchants use are rigged. Garcia shows up, ordering her to stop causing trouble and begins ridiculing Zorro. Suddenly Zorro appears and orders Garcia at sword-point to get on the scale, which shows that Garcia supposedly weighs \"only 50 pounds.\" After Zorro toys with the clumsy Garcia at swords for some time, soldiers appear, but since Chico and some other boys have dumped their rifles down a well, they are forced to go after Zorro with swords. Naturally, following an athletic chase through the marketplace Zorro escapes, and Hortensia looks on with admiration. Later, Hortensia returns to her home, where she finds Zorro waiting. Zorro and Hortensia talk for only a few moments before Huerta arrives. Hortensia urges Zorro to go, saying that she is afraid for him. Zorro leaves. Huerta arrives and tells his men to search the area. When Hortensia tells him that her parents aren\\'t home, he decides to stay for a while. After Hortensia rejects Huerta\\'s marriage proposal, he forcefully kisses her. At this, Zorro re-appears and  forces Huerta to get on his knees and beg Hortensia\\'s forgiveness. Huerta leaves in a huff, and Zorro and Hortensia share a romantic moment. Aunt Carmen has decided to return to Spain , escorted by Kapitan von Markel. Zorro and Joaquin, knowing that Huerta will certainly have his men rob the party in the guise of bandits, secretly follow. When the party makes camp for the night, the \"bandits\" attack, but von Markel  fights back and drives them off, exciting the admiration  of Carmen. The \"bandits\" escape with the treasure, but Zorro catches up with them and steals the jewels back. Diego begins an elaborate scheme, first with a scroll note from the dog, then a ransacked dining room marked with Z\\'s, to make it appear that Zorro is plotting to kill the Governor. After \"de la Serna\" takes to his bed in fear, Huerta informs Diego that he has the perfect plan to capture Zorro. He says his men will capture Hortensia, lock her in a cage and cart her around the plaza until Zorro comes to rescue her. Soldiers will be everywhere, so Zorro cannot escape. Zorro outwits them by going straight to Hortensia\\'s cell at the prison and waiting for her to arrive. He rescues Hortensia, and stays behind to distract the guards. Zorro escapes, and overhears Huerta and Garcia. Huerta says that only one other person knew of the plan. He rides off to the governor\\'s mansion, and Zorro manages to get back just before Huerta arrives. Huerta and Diego argue a bit about Zorro, and it is clear that Huerta is suspicious. Diego then offers himself to be bait for Zorro. The next day, Diego and Garcia go on a fishing trip. Soldiers are surrounding the area. Joaquin shows up as Zorro, and almost all the soldiers follow him. Eluding the soldiers, Joaquin rides to Brother Francisco\\'s mission. Brother Francisco informs the children of Zorro\\'s plan, and sends them out to different areas dressed as Zorro as distractions to the soldiers. Diego pretends to go to the carriage for a nap, but reappears as the real Zorro, telling Garcia he has the governor at gunpoint, and will \"wring his neck and have him stuffed and fed to the dog\" if Garcia doesn\\'t do what he tells him. Garcia, with Zorro, arrives at a mine run by forced slave labor. He orders the guards to release them all, or else Zorro will kill the Governor. With Brother Francisco\\'s help, the slaves are freed, and Zorro tells Garcia to leave. Hortensia arrives and tells Zorro that Huerta and the soldiers are coming. When Zorro leaves with the carriage, Hortensia holds onto the back to ride with him. Huerta and his men give chase. Zorro stops the carriage long enough to order Hortensia to leave, saying that the people need her. He kisses her, Hortensia leaves, and then Zorro drives the carriage off a cliff into the ocean. Hortensia looks over in disbelief, and Huerta arrives. Huerta says that now Nuova Aragon will have a new governor  and Hortensia, if her parents know what\\'s best for them, will have a husband. On the day of the wedding, Brother Francisco and civilians arrive at the church in protest. Huerta orders the guards to arrest him, but they are reluctant to do so. To everyone\\'s surprise , Zorro reappears unharmed. He battles soldiers on the roof of the church, while on the ground Kapitan von Markel assists the angry crowd in handling the soldiers. Huerta grabs a soldier\\'s pistol and shoots Brother Francisco at point-blank range, killing him and causing a riot to break out. Huerta\\'s armed soldiers settle the riot down, and Zorro, feeling that Brother Francisco\\'s murder has released him from his promise to Miguel de la Serna, begins a final showdown and duel to the death with Huerta. The fight goes on for many minutes, going from the doorstep of the church to the inside. During the duel Zorro repeats Huerta\\'s trick with the candles, only better—splitting one in half. Later on, Zorro falls out through a stained glass window and Huerta believes Zorro is dead. However, Zorro reappears in the darkness of the bell tower and the fight continues. In the meantime, the dog Assassin prevents Garcia from interfering, causing the fat sergeant to back into and fall down a well. On the roof, Huerta says that either he or Zorro must die. Zorro then says, \"Well then...let it be the moment of truth.\" and unmasks himself. In a simultaneous lunge, Diego kills Huerta, causing him to fall from the roof. The crowd looks on stunned, then bursts into applause. Zorro then appears in a valley on his horse, and in romantic fashion, rides off. The tyrant is dead. Justice has triumphed. Long live Zorro!'},\n",

When she tells him it's in her bathroom, he takes her in there and smears it across her face, then forces her to perform fellatio on him to leave the traces of the lipstick on his genitalia. Returning her to her bed, he ties her down with silk scarves, and anally rapes her to the accompaniment of his discordant compositions. Near the end of the ordeal, Kathy returns home from school and walks in on Chris and Gordon, who Kathy has a crush on, together in bed -- hurt and embarrassed, Kathy runs out before they see her, and before she can tell what's really going on. Chris hears her leave, and asks Gordon to untie her. He gets up and suggests calling Kathy in to join them and “Have some fun,” but he instead cuts Chris free and leaves. Chris gets up, finds Kathy, and after telling her what really happened, Chris calls the police. Gordon is arrested, but as Chris learns from Carla Bondi , the prosecutor assigned to handle the case, Gordon's conviction is hardly a sure thing. Only two out of 100 rapists serve any jail time, and only 10,000 out of the 50,000 rapes that occur each year in California are reported to the police. If Chris wants justice, she’ll have to testify, and that could mean subjecting herself to a kind of abuse as terrible as the rape itself. Despite Steve’s fears of what a trial could do to her career, Chris agrees to testify passionately, informing everyone in the room that “I want him to die in jail! I want them to do it to him in jail!” Unfortunately for Chris, Carla’s worst fears are all realized. Gordon's attorney argues that the sex was consensual, and that its roughness was the result of Chris's own twisted desires and not Gordon's. He also suggests that even if Gordon acted without her consent, she provoked him by appearing naked in front of him at the photo shoot where they first met, and by the inherent sensuality of the photographs from which she makes her living. To Chris's enormous shock, the jury buys that logic and votes to acquit. Gordon walks out of the courthouse a free man. Not long after that, Chris learns that Steve, who works for the cosmetics company she poses for, has decided to “cool down” their ad campaign, meaning that she's been abandoned by Steve, and is soon going to be out of work. Not knowing what else to do, Chris decides to move to Colorado with Kathy as soon she finishes what is to be her last photo shoot. But by a terrible coincidence, Kathy’s old school is using the same building Chris’s shoot is in to rehearse the new ballet being orchestrated by Gordon. As Chris poses in a red sequined gown, Kathy runs into Gordon, who -- despite her protestations to the contrary -- a part of her still believes is innocent of what Chris accused him of. Kathy soon learns, however, that Chris wasn’t lying when Gordon’s intentions become sinister, and he starts chasing her throughout the nearly abandoned building. Eventually, he catches her, starts tearing at her clothes and rapes her. When Gordon is done with her, Kathy stumbles to the photo shoot and tells Chris what happened. Knowing she absolutely cannot trust the system to do what's right, Chris -- still wearing the red gown -- runs outside to her vehicle and grabs a pump-action shotgun that she had intended to take to Colorado with her. Chris spots Gordon driving his car in the parking lot, and shoots at it. Gordon is hit by a bullet. He tries running Chris over, but the car swirls and overturns on its side. With difficulty, Gordon climbs out of the car, and Chris shoots him in his chest, shoulder and stomach. Gordon falls out of the car. Chris comes near to the place where Gordon is writhing in pain. Convulsing, he tries hard getting up, but Chris shoots him between his legs, killing him instantly. Even after his death, Chris keeps shooting, while being haunted by the dirty memories of her ugly rape. Within seconds, the police arrive and arrest Chris. Later, Carla Bondi speaks to a jury, telling them that their acquittal of the devillish Gordon earlier resulted in Chris losing faith in the law and in order for the Los Angeles department of justice to not appear appallingly incompetent they have to acquit Chris. The Jury ultimately finds Chris not guilty.\"},\n",

Sent to a remote town as part of a covert training operation, De Ming is placed under the supervision of the local police captain, Xu Dachun. Xu’s mission: facilitate De Ming’s integration into the community while protecting the secret of his young protégé’s true identity. Charmed with a talent for delivering both justice and compassion, De Ming is quick to win the hearts of the town residents—though none more completely than that of Su Mei, a fellow officer who also happens to be the object of the captain’s secret affection. Nothing in De Ming’s programming has prepared him for this. But affairs of the heart are put on hold when word arrives that one of De Ming’s cybernetic siblings, the K-88, has disappeared after suffering a critical neural meltdown.

              "  'plot': '{{plot}} The film opens on a long strand of beach, where several people in white robes gather around a young man named Ilius, adorning him in a vest of leather armor, while an old man hands him a bow and a set of arrows, summoning it to fly to them. The old man tells Ilius the tale of an ancient warrior god named Kronos, who once wielded the bow, and how when he ran out of arrows, the sun itself seemed to vanish from the sky, transferring itself to his bow, making arrows out of pure sunlight. After telling Ilius this tale, the old man and his people depart as Ilius wordlessly departs down the beach. We are then introduced to a powerful sorceress named Ohkren, a woman whose entire head is adorned in a golden mask as she recites a magical chant to make the sun rise before a large gathering of cave-dwelling people. However, it turns out that Ohkren is a sadistic, cruel witch who commands a savage army of wolfmen who quickly invade the caves of these people, slaying their leader, and grabbing a young woman who attempts to flee, and is graphically torn into quarters as Ohkren cracks her severed head open, seemingly devouring part of her brain. In a strange, dreamlike sequence, Ohkren and her wolfmen partake in hallucinogenic drugs when suddenly, a young man devoid of any facial features charges into their chamber, and dispatches Ohkren and the wolfmen with the same magic bow that was given to Ilius. It is then revealed that this was all part of a vision, as Ohkren fears a lone wanderer shall come to slay her. In a fog-filled murky swamp, a lone girl with skin covered in ash, is collecting water from the marshes when she is suddenly attacked by a group of masked men. But they are killed when Ilius arrives with his bow and arrows at the ready. Unfortunately, he soon runs out of arrows and tries to flee, a group of Ohkren\\'s wolfmen attack him, but just when it seems that Ilius will die, he is saved by a lone muscular man who easily fends off the attackers with a rock attached to a sling. The lone man reveals his name to be Mace, he offers to accompany Ilius in exchange for saving his life and if Ilius teaches him how to use the bow. Ohkren is quickly informed of her warriors\\' failure to kill Ilius, and she resolves to have him dead, no matter what it takes. Its revelaed that Mace has a sort of Beastmasterish type of power as he rescues a hawk and nurtures it back to health. Mace has developed a bit of talent with Ilius\\' bow and shows off by killing a lone caveman, for no apparent reason. They take shelter in a cave for the night, but as they sleep, Ohkren\\'s wolfmen trap the two heroes inside, blocking all the entrances with burning bushes. Ilius and Mace make an escape through a hole in the ground, but once again find themselves trapped. Fortunately, Ilius notices a snake on the ground slithering through a small hole in the cave wall, Mace fiugres they can get out the same way the snake did. The two quickly break through the thin stone wall and make their escape. This failure is again noticed by Ohkren when she has another vision of the faceless warrior. As punishment, she tortures the leader of her wolfmen to death, and quickly summons a being dressed in plated armor skirt and a plated mask named Zora, who swears that he shall kill the wanderer for her. As Ilius and Mace continue their travels, they come across a small tribe of the cave people, who are apparently familiar with Mace, and invite them in for the night. During the feast they hold, Ilius recognizes one of the girls in the tribe as the girl he saved in the swamps, who has taken a strong liking to him. In the dead of night as the others sleep, the girl takes Ilius to the outside of the cave in an attempt to have sex with him, but Ohkren\\'s warriors have tracked down Ilius and Mace and viciously slaughter the girl and all her people. Ilius is dragged away by the attackers as Mace is knocked out in the attack. When he awakens, Mace resolves to rescue Ilius, as he has come to accept Ilius as his one friend. He manages to find the band of Ohkren\\'s warriors with Ilius in tow as they have all made camp for the night. Mace swiftly dispatches several of the warriors as he frees Ilius, who manages to grab his magic bow and help Mace slay the rest of their enemies. At this point, Ilius finally explains to Mace that he is on a quest to slay the evil sorceress Ohkren, and put an end to her reign of terror over the people of the land. Although Mace tries to convince Ilius to go back to his land, as Ohkren is too powerful, Ilius refuses to go home until his task is complete. Mace eventually decides that he shall aid Ilius in any way he can, but he still feels that this is a fools errand, as no man has ever managed to slay Ohkren yet. After inexplicably building a raft and then abandoning it. Mace and Ilius travel through an open field, Mace notices that he and Ilius have wandered into an area with some sort of sentient plant. The plant soon reveals its predatory nature by firing a massive rain of quills in order to kill them. Realizing they don\\'t stand a chance, Mace and Ilius try to run to safer ground. They soon reach the small beach where they abandoned their raft, but Ilius is suddenly shot in the leg with a quill, which was coated with an extremely deadly poison which manifests itself in boils that ooze blood and pus. They depart the beach via the raft, but with Ilius growing more and more ill, Mace brings the raft to a small island, where he explains that there are some special plants that could heal the ailment. Mace rushes off to the heart of the island where he soon enters a dark and foreboding swamp. He quickly locates the plant, but as he makes his way back to Ilius, he is attacked by a large band of zombies. Upon discovering that they can be killed by impalment, he dispatches a few and manages to escape the rest. Mace returns to Ilius, who begs him to hurry and end his pain, but to his surprise, Mace grabs a large rock, preparing to kill him with it, but he is suddenly attacked by another Mace. The two warriors clash until one Mace manages to pin the other to the sand with a large branch. The pinned Mace laughs and reveals himself to be Zora, the plated skirt spirit that Ohkren had summoned, just before he disappears into thin air. Although shaken by the encounter, Mace quickly makes the healing plant into a paste through the night and administers it to Ilius\\' wounds, effectively terminating the poison from the arrow. With Ilius fully recovered, he decides to continue on his journey to kill Ohkren, but this time, Mace refuses to go with him, as he is not willing to die for a task that cannot be done. Although disappointed, Ilius decides to respect his friends wish and offers his bow to Mace as a gift. Mace refuses, stating that the bow has brought too much pain and death to too many people since their adventure started. Ilius then rows off to sea with the raft as Mace departs back the way they came. As Mace travels along the rocky coast, he is soon ambushed by a band of white furry creatures. They demand to know where Ilius is and when he refuses to reveal that information they tie him to a wooden \"X\" one the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile, Ilius realizes that he can\\'t abandon his friend nor can he continue alone. Ilius returns to the coast that the creatures dwell near and spots Mace and quickly realizes the predicament. Ilius attacks the creatures with his magic bow, harnessing the sun arrows power at last as he is no longer afraid of the dangers that await him, unlocking his true potential. However, he is unable to prevent one last survivor of the creatures from pushing Mace off the cliff into the sea below. Mace sinks to the bottom of the sea and is unable to free himself as he is tied to the cross, and nearly drowns, but he uses his animal power and calls two dolphins who half heartedly save him. Ilius, despondent over Mace\\'s death or his own culpability in Mace\\'s demise, is relieved to find him on the beach and resuscitates him. In gratitude for saving his life, Mace agrees to stay with Ilius for the remainder of their journey. Making camp in another cave, Ilius is soon dragged under the ground by some sort of creature. As he loses his bow, he isn\\'t able to put up a fight and is last seen being drug into the dark. Mace is awakened by Ilius\\'s cries and jumps into the hole after him. Mace, unable to see clearly, manages to fight off a few of the creatures, until he is overpowered and thrown into a small pit. Mace soon awakens a horde of bats inside the cave, and in the madness of their whole swarm flying around him, Mace notices a blue bat who seems to guide him through a small tunnel that he can use to escape. He reaches the exit, but his elation is deflated as he soon notices blood dripping on him. Upon glancing up, he notices Ilius hanging upside down from the ceiling of the cave, decapitated. Zora is then shown in Ohkren\\'s chamber, carrying Ilius\\' severed head in his hand, as Ohkren rejoices at having destroyed the one who would kill her. Her victory is cut short when she sees the head open its eyes and realizes that though Ilius\\'s body may be dead, his soul lives and that for as long as it does she remains in danger. Back in the caves, Mace has built a funeral pyre for Ilius. As he stands at his side, Mace hears Ilius\\' voice, telling him that with his death, he passes the powers he inherited from Kronos unto Mace. When the fire dies down, Mace rubs the ashes of Ilius onto his skin, personally resolving to finish Ilius\\' quest, and to slay Ohkren for him. On the cliff where Ohkren was first shown raising the sun, she is once again reciting the sun chant, surrounded by her remaining soldiers and Zora. She is suddenly interrupted Mace, who announces that he has come to avenge Ilius and that this day, the sun shall rise without Ohkren. Stretching out his hand, Mace is now able to summon forth the bow just as the old man did in the beginning. With newfound resolve and courage, Mace easily slaughters the rest of Ohkren\\'s soldiers. Zora takes off leaving Ohkren to die. She quickly flees by teleporting into her chamber, however, Mace undaunted fires an arrow that goes through the mountain and knocks her mask off. When Mace arrives in Ohkren\\'s chamber, the sorceress rises, revealing her face to be that of a rotted zombie, but apparently blinded as she is unable to find Mace. Knowing Ilius\\' task is close to an end, Mace fires one final arrow into Ohkren\\'s heart, seemingly slaying the sorceress. However, she is later seen in her wolf form running off with Zora, who has also returned to his wolf form. The cave people, and the people across the land take notice of the change brought on by Ohkren\\'s death, and the film ends as Mace departs from the cave, walking off into the distant sunrise with Ilius\\' bow strapped to his back, finally at peace that he has avenged his friend, and finished what he started.'},\n",

Not only is Francisco an unsuspected political arch-rival, but he is also keeping an eye on Menda's glamorous wife Carla , with whom he fancies his chances once Menda is out of the way.

To replace them, humans began keeping apes as household pets. Realizing the apes\\' capacity to learn and adapt, humans train them to perform household tasks. By 1991, American culture is based on ape slave labor. Armando and Caesar , a young chimpanzee horseback rider in Armando\\'s circus, distribute flyers around a large city to advertise the circus\\' arrival. Armando warns the chimpanzee to be careful; should anyone learn his identity as the son of Cornelius and Zira, it would mean their deaths. They see apes performing various menial tasks, and are shocked at the harsh discipline on disobedient apes. Seeing an ape being beaten and drugged, Caesar shouts, \"Lousy human bastards!\" Quickly, Armando takes responsibility for the exclamation, explaining to the policemen that it was he who shouted, not his chimpanzee. The surrounding crowd becomes agitated, and Caesar flees. Hiding in a stairway, Armando tells Caesar he will go to the authorities and bluff his way out of the situation. Meantime, Caesar has to hide among his own kind  and soon finds himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He is then sold at auction to Governor Breck ([[Don Murray .

He meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn  on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures. Henderson and Flynn have friendly arguments and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto  to be Henderson\\'s translator. Their work permits them blunt and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from an orphanage located on the front lines  in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly brutal attacks fail to make the lead story in England, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war. When American aid worker Nina  organizes a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of several orphaned Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces Nina to include a Bosniak girl from the orphanage, Emira , to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act -- Emira\\'s mother is still alive and signed no papers authorizing the evacuation -- but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story. Despite a UN escort, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. The final harassment is the worst -- a group of Chetniks halt the bus, forcibly disembark the Bosnian Serb children and put them on their armed lorry, presumably to repatriate them. When Henderson finally makes it to London with Emira, Emira quickly becomes a member of Henderson\\'s family in a comfortable London home. After an ambiguous interval of perhaps 100 days, Henderson receives word from his former producer, who is still in Sarajevo, that Emira\\'s mother wants Emira back. Henderson returns to Sarajevo, now riven not only by the siege but also by internal organized crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian-Herzegovinan soldier. Henderson recruits Risto to find Emira\\'s mother. They nearly succeed, but the unstable situation unravels around them and they are forced to retreat. When Risto is killed by a sniper in his own home, Henderson falls back on Zeljko , a concierge at the Holiday Inn who Henderson had helped in previous Sarajevo tours. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira\\'s mother. As prelude to signing the adoption papers, she outlines the reasons she wants Emira back. She cannot in good conscience bring Emira back to Sarajevo, though, and she signs the papers. A running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that \"the people will die happily listening to my music.\" The movie ends with Harun holding a \"concert of peace\" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajeva had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth. The closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.'},\n",

Tomas finishes the letter, and falls asleep. Awakened by the return of Jonas, Tomas clumsily tries to provide counsel, before finally admitting that he has no faith as well. He tells the depressed man that his  faith was an egotistical one – God loved humanity, but Tomas most of all. Serving in Lisbon during the Spanish Civil War, Tomas could not reconcile his loving God with the atrocities being committed, so he ignored them.

Shot in an awkward, distant style , Tomas stoically helps the police cover Jonas\\'s body with a tarp, then stands guard while waiting for the \"van\" to collect the body, which arrives shortly. Märta arrives on foot, and she and Tomas drive off to her home, where she invites him in to take some medicine for his cold. Waiting in the classroom attached to her house , Tomas finally lashes out at her, telling her first that he rejected her because he was tired of the gossip about them. When that fails to deter her affections, Tomas then tells her that he was tired of her constant talking, and that Märta could never measure up to his late wife, the only woman he has ever loved. Though shocked by the attack, Märta agrees to drive with him to the Persson house. Informed of Jonas\\'s suicide, Karin collapses onto the stairs and wonders how she and her children will go on.

Meanwhile in the vestry, Algot questions Tomas about the Passion.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking this perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins, as we interweave her story with another… Far away, a brilliant research geneticist at UC Berkeley named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science magazine -- quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees.King, M-C. and Wilson, A.C. \"Evolution at two levels in humans and chimpanzees.\" Science 188, 107-116 . But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at last some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough -- the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene -- considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth centuryKevin Davies and Michael White. \"Breakthrough: The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene.\" . and touch thousands of lives, including that of a young woman living thousands of miles away, named Anne Parker. At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Anne’s sister contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she too is dead. Married, with a child, and only in her 20’s, Anne Parker’s challenges have hardly begun. She herself is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe and surgery and chemotherapy with all its accompanying difficulties soon follows. She loses her hair and if that was that enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne’s closest friend, and leaves her, shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. And this is where many stories would end; with tragedy of unimaginable anguish and an almost surreal relentlessness, but Anne Parker is not an ordinary woman and hers is not an ordinary story. With the help of a young doctor, Sean, and a new friend, Kim, Anne continues her fight. As each tragedy befalls her, something remarkable happens. She grows stronger. As each new sadness comes, she grows more resolved; as her world becomes darker, she becomes, well… funnier. So funny that she makes other patients laugh. So funny her doctors are far more serious about her illness than she is. So positive, that she becomes a life force onto herself, determined to survive it all. And something else —- she believes that she must find the genetic secret that hid in her family and had killed almost all of them. It becomes the focus of her considerable energies. While Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite \"the disappeared\" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in Science magazine a short time later.Hall, J.M. et al. \"Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21.\" Science 250, 1684-89 . Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time magazine; and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. This same Anne Parker, now happily remarried, who a few years later would contract cancer for a third time. And she would survive again. And she laughed while being treated, for reasons only she knew and understood. Anne Parker still lives a full life to this day.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Decoding-Annie-Parker/218537534833277?sk=info'},\n",

She tries to steal the car, but it is locked. The weather is so ferocious that she ends up crawling to the top of a hill where, to her horror, Mr. Murray is waiting for her. Back at the house, she demands to know what is going on. Dr. Lewis pretends her imagination is running wild. Katie realizes that Mr. Murray has drugged her hot chocolate, and she returns to her room, barricading the door with a mound of furniture before she passes out. As she sleeps, Mr. Murray enters her room from behind her full-length mirror. Katie wakes up in a fresh sleeping gown with a bandaged hand. She peels off the bandages to find that her left ring finger has been removed. Seeing that her barricade is undisturbed, Katie quickly finds the door behind the mirror and sees a staircase to the attic, which has a working phone. She calls Rob and explains that they are going to kill her. Rob asks where she is, but Katie can only remember vague landmarks about the drive upstate. Rob orders her to hang up the phone and call the police, which she does. As she collapses on a sofa, she sees the body of Julie Rose. Mr. Murray arrives and rips the handset out of the phone, taking her back downstairs to Dr. Lewis. As Dr. Lewis redresses her finger, he explains that Julia was involved in a vicious family feud with her sister, Evelyn. As a radical therapy, Dr. Lewis had convinced her to blackmail her sister, theorizing that it would help her achieve a catharsis. He was pleased with Julie\\'s progress, but did not expect Evelyn to kill her, ordering the hit man to take her finger as proof. During his explanation, the police arrive. Dr. Lewis has just sedated Katie, and the combination of the sedative which confuses Katie and Dr. Lewis\\' claim that she is his patient convince the police to leave without much of an investigation. Meanwhile, Rob and Roland have begun to drive upstate, using the handful of clues they have to try to locate Katie. When Katie wakes again, Evelyn is standing over her. Dr. Lewis is displaying Katie to prove that Julie is still alive and continue the blackmail. Katie slowly emerges from the sedative as Mr. Murray returns her to her room. Awake again, she fakes an escape attempt, luring Dr. Lewis and Mr. Murray out of the house. She pleads with Evelyn to help her escape, but Evelyn is convinced she is really Julie and attacks her. Katie kills Evelyn and poses as her to try to escape. When Mr. Murray realizes the ruse, Katie stabs him in the neck. Dr. Lewis is also not fooled by the disguise and lunges out of his wheelchair at Katie. Using a fire poker as a crutch, he follows her upstairs and eventually into the attic, where Katie manages to kill him. Rob and Roland arrive with the police, who they had convinced to revisit the house.'},\n",

While on a class trip, Ambika gives a note to Kamal that asks him to meet her in his room. Ambika claims that, that night, Kamal entered her room and both had consensual sex, but Kamal denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison. But soon the truth comes out. During the class trip, Kamal never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj kumar, who was also their classmate. Raj, lusting after Ambika, uses this opportunity to enter Ambika’s room on the pretext of being Kamal and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Ambika didn’t know the difference. Kamal, forgives Ambika and gets back with Radha while the bad guys are punished. The movie paired Ambika and her real-life sister Radha in roles of sisters on-screen. Nadia was first offered the role of the younger sister. She refused it and the role went to Radha. The two sisters delivered stunning performances that are fondly remembered by a generation of fans. Ambika played the role of a young and beautiful, yet strong and single woman with aplomb. In this role she plays a dominating business tycoon with a powerful personality. She portrays a controlling and protective older sister for younger Radha, while simultaneously demonstrating a highly glamorous and desirable personality herself. Very soon, in a flashback, she displays a totally different personality as a pretty and carefree college girl, switching between the two roles effortlessly. The director does a beautiful job of selecting scenes that portray all the varying aspects of Ambika's varied persona in the movie, such as a scene that puts her in a corporate boss role, a scene that has her questioning her sister protectively, a scene that shows her caring side in a poor children's home and a scene that underscores her youth and physical beauty in the dressing room. Radha also looks her best in the movie, an actress at the height of her commercial success, totally confident and comfortable about pairing up with her more experienced sister. She refuses to be overshadowed by her elder sister in the movie and comes across as a distinct and talented actress. This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.\"},\n",

The relationship between Hueyin and mother Aiko, who is Japanese, hadn't been stellar since childhood. From many flashbacks, we see it was Hueyin's paternal grandparents who did much of the early child-rearing, however, they would often overstep boundaries, resulting in family dysfunction. Before the end of World War II and before eventually becoming Mrs. Cheung and Hueyin's mother, Aiko spent time living in Manchukuo. There, she and other Japanese faced serious dilemmas after Japan's defeat and the subsequent uncertainties of imprisonment and punishment. The most intense of these dilemmas came with the serious illness of Aiko's infant nephew. His illness was eventually cured by Mr. Cheung after a chance encounter and desperate roadside plea for help by Aiko. Mr. Cheung was an army translator from Guangdong, China with a background in traditional Chinese medicine. Aiko developed a sense of fondness for him upon seeing his actions and character. Aiko's brother concurred, mentioning that kindness toward children usually indicates a man of integrity. After Mr. Cheung escorted Aiko's family to the Japanese repatriation site, he revealed to Aiko a strong desire to be a romantic couple. The film focuses on Hueyin's journey of epiphany as she and Aiko visit Aiko's birthplace in Beppu, Japan, where many years of mother-daughter tension are finally reversed.\"},\n",

Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith. The Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him. However, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat  beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh.

The egg is taken by an Oviraptor, who drops it into a river while fighting another Oviraptor, and finally is taken by a Pteranodon to an island inhabited by lemurs, who see the egg hatch, name the baby dinosaur Aladar, and raise him as their own. When Aladar is an adult, the island is destroyed when an asteroid crashes on earth, causing a meteor shower, with only Aladar, his grandfather Yar, his mother Plio, his best friend Zini and his sister Suri surviving the destruction of the island by swimming to the land After fleeing a pack of Velociraptor, the family meets a multi-species herd of dinosaurs  led by the Iguanodon Kron and his lieutenant Bruton, who are on a journey to reach the \"Nesting Grounds\", a valley believed to be untouched by the devastation of the asteroid impact. Aladar and the lemurs befriend a trio of elderly dinosaurs: Baylene the Brachiosaurus, Eema the Styracosaurus, and Url, Eema\\'s dog-like pet Ankylosaurus. Aladar also develops romantic feelings for Kron\\'s sister Neera, but she is uninterested. Meanwhile, the Velociraptor pack continues to follow them, but are scared off when a pair of Carnotaurs picks up the herd\\'s trail too. The herd arrives at a lake they’ve relied on for past trips, but it has dried up. Aladar saves the herd from dehydration when he and Baylene eventually dig up the trapped water beneath the ground. Aladar and Neera eventually fall in love after Neera sees Aladar helping the dinosaurs  survive. However, Bruton, having been sent by Kron to find water upon arrival at the lake, returns injured by the Carnotaur which killed another Iguanodon that was scouting with him. Kron evacuates the herd from the lake bed in a rush, leaving Aladar, the lemurs, the elderly dinosaurs, and the injured Bruton behind. The small group recuperates in a cave during a rainstorm, with Bruton eventually befriending them. When the Carnotaur pair attacks, Bruton’s loyalty is proven when he kills one of them as the others escape to the depths of the caves, being killed in the process. But one of the Carnotaurs escapes, enraged by the death of its mate but unable to follow the group. Upon reaching a dead end, Aladar begins to lose hope, after repeated failures and the loss of Bruton. His friends all join in breaking down the dead end, stabilizing his confidence. Finally, Baylene demolishes the wall. The dead end actually leads to the \"Nesting Grounds\", where Eema sees that the old entrance – where the herd has gathered on the other side – has been blocked by a landslide generated by the meteors. Aladar rushes to find the herd on the other side, accidentally alerting and being tracked by the Carnotaur. He finds the herd being directed by Kron to climb the rocks, which can\\'t be passed without fatality, but when he suggests the alternate route he found, Kron becomes enraged at his authority being questioned and challenged, and battles Aladar for leadership of the herd. Despite landing a few good hits, Aladar is outclassed by Kron, who only stops short of killing Aladar when Neera, tired of her brother\\'s illogical beliefs, strikes him down and defends Aladar. Aladar and Neera take control of the herd, but Kron refuses to submit to the leadership of another and begins climbing the rocks himself. The Carnotaur then confronts them, but Aladar rallies the herd to drive it off by standing together and scaring it off with intimidation. The Carnotaur leaves the herd alone, but spots Kron who mistakes that Aladar lead the Carnotaur to the herd climbing the rocks alone, and is followed by Neera and Aladar as it charges to kill the former leader of the herd. In the ensuing fight, Kron is severely wounded by the Carnotaur, but Aladar is able to push the predator off a cliff to its death. Kron, however, succumbs to his injuries and dies with Aladar and Neera at his side. Aladar and Neera lead the herd back to the \"Nesting Grounds\", where the two eventually mate and have children, and the lemurs find more of their own kind. Plio narrates the ending, wishing for their story to be remembered in history. She then says, \"But one thing is for sure. Our journey is not over, we can only hope in some small way our time here will be remembered.\"'},\n",

The local police dismiss her story as the ramblings of a senile and bored old woman, so, undaunted, she conducts her own investigation, and comes to the conclusion that the body must be buried on the grounds of Ackenthorpe Hall, which adjoins the railway line. Wheedling her way into a job as housemaid there, Marple copes with the pompous machinations of her difficult employer, Luther Ackenthorpe , so she can search for the mysterious corpse, and eventually finds it while supposedly practicing her golf shots.

As with most of her appearances in the role, Margaret Rutherford's flamboyant, comical portrayal of the sleuth was quite different from Christie's languid, passive depiction. The tone of the novel was also changed somewhat; instead of Christie's trademark suspense and underlying darkness, the film relied heavily on light, even whimsical comedy of manners.

A worried Anderson visits a fellow Army veteran, Ray Shaff, in New York. Shaff admits that he sold evidence of a past homosexual relationship between the two. Hudson, Anderson\\'s friend Smith, and others attempt to counsel the troubled chairman but, unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson commits suicide. The President denies to Munson and Hudson knowing about the blackmail. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell\\'s confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher, forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson\\'s death, nonetheless, permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate. In the Senate Chamber Cooley apologizes for his \"vindictiveness\". While he will vote against Leffingwell and his \"alien voice\", the senator will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley\\'s action, cites the \"tragic circumstances\" surrounding the confirmation. Although the majority leader will vote for Leffingwell, he will permit a conscience vote from others. Hudson\\'s quorum call and the majority leader\\'s refusal to yield the floor prevent Van Ackerman from speaking, and Munson asks for the \"Yeas and Nays\", ending debate. The majority leader tells the senator that were it not for the Andersons\\' privacy the Senate would censure and expel him. Van Ackerman angrily leaves the chamber before the vote. Munson\\'s side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell and the majority leader prepares for the Vice President to break the tie in the nominee\\'s favor. Secret Service agents enter the chamber and Hudson receives a message from the Senate Chaplain. He announces that he will not break the tie, causing the nomination to fail, and that the President has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own Secretary of State. The film ends as Munson makes a motion to adjourn due to the former president\\'s death.'},\n",

              "  'plot': \"{{plot}} The film opens with a scene of people giving police complaints of the same fraud. Police broadcast the picture of the suspect on TV. Elsewhere, Annamalai  is arrested by the police in a hospital after being injured in a bus accident, under the charges of cheating and marrying four women with false identities. The four victims also confirm after seeing Annamalai that he was the one who cheated them. Annamalai is produced in the court where the judge  offers him a free lawyer owing to his inability to pay for one, but he prefers to argue his own case. Proceedings start as Rekha  is produced as the first witness. She explains how she came into contact with a rich man from London called Vignesh and how he charmed her. A friend of Vignesh called Napolean informs Rekha that Vignesh's parents want him to come to London in two days to make him marry a rich young woman. Rekha suggests that they both marry next day without much formality, so as to prevent marriage with the London girl. After marrying her, Vignesh cheats Rekha's brother Tyagu, a construction company owner, of Rs.25 lakhs intended as bribe for a government minister by acting as a middle-man between Tyagu and the minister in obtaining licence for a construction tender. He also decamps with Rekha's jewels worth Rs.40 lakhs next day after the marriage. However, Vignesh had postponed marriage registration and formal invitation printing owing to his apparent urgency to go to London. He also wanted the photographer to take the wedding photos in his personal digital camera saying he will send the prints from London. Annamalai argues that since there was no proof of a marriage between Vignesh and Rekha in terms of photos or registration, she cannot accuse him of cheating him; he states that he is not Vignesh. He, in turn, accuses Rekha's brother of trying to bribe the minister of Rs.25 lakhs. The fingerprints analyzed on the suitcases were found not to match with Annamalai's prints. The next victim is Ammu Kutty  from Cochin. She meets Madhavan Menon who helps lift up her picnic car when it was stuck in a hole. Then regular meetings passed and both started to love each other. When Ammu Kutty's family decide to marry her to a man in her relations, Ammu Kutty and Madhavan elope with her jewels. Napoleon then calls Ammu Kutty and says Madhavan has to pay Rs.10 lakhs deposit regarding a tea estate business; today is the last date. Ammu Kutty also learns from Napolean that Madhavan is the son of the sister of Kerala's chief minister. Madhavan says he doesn't have that much money. Ammu then gives him all her jewels for this. Madhavan hesitates but later takes it and goes to pay the deposit. But he doesn't return. Someone informs her family of her location and they come and drag Ammu Kutty to her house. Annamalai then cross questions Ammu Kutty. He says it's her fault to have chosen a husband without even knowing properly who he was. When he asks for her thali , she says she threw it away in anger. Annamalai states that the thali should not be disrespected like this and hence she is lying. He repeats that he is not the criminal. Meanwhile, Anjali, the daughter of the judge who was watching the case from the beginning recalls how the criminal cheated her. Anjali met Zakir Hussain at an art gallery and they started to love each other. Anjali wanted to buy one of his paintings. Zakir agreed to bring the covered Rs.1 lakh painting to her house. Zakir entices Anjali by proposing to her and leaving for Hyderabad on work. When Anjali opens the painting, it is revealed to be a blank sheet. Anjali then goes to the art gallery where she meets the real Zakir Hussain who says that there was a man whose name was also Zakir Hussain who was a fan of his art. After this incident, Anjali develops an affinity toward Annamalai, still believing him to be the man who cheated her cleverly. The police then perform a narco analysis and lie detector test on Annamalai without success. A man called David Fernandez comes to the police and claims that the accused is his brother Josef Fernandez and not Annamalai. When he says this in the court, Annamalai refutes the claim saying he is a Hindu. He adds that it has become clear that it was Josef Fernandez who took wrong examples of role models and who has cheated the victims. The police perform a DNA test with the blood of Annamalai and David to see if they are really brothers and the test ends in failure. Annamalai states that his mother's name is Annapoorni and they were living at the village called Vataparai which the police verify. Rani  and her mother Chandra Bai appear as the next victims of fraud. Chandra Bai, who is a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna had done a public prayer for a revered saint, Harihara Das, to come to her ashram. A few days later, Harihara Das arrives at the ashram and states that Rani is the incarnation of Radha. They are also made to believe that Harihara Das is the incarnation of Lord Krishna, who has come to marry Rani, who is Radha's incarnation. Chandra Bai receives a phone call from Napoleon asking the Harihara Das to visit his place. Short of time, Rani and Harihara Das marry. Then Harihara Das fools everyone into thinking that he disappeared and went to heaven, while escaping with the jewels of the ashram. Annamalai says that this is just plain foolishness and fanaticism on the part of Chandra Bai and Rani and says the court cannot accept witnesses who are fools. He again states he is not the one who cheated them as Harihara Das. The last victim is identified as Monika  who is the managing director of Videocon. Unlike the other witnesses, she says she loved Annamalai who introduced himself to her with the name Shyam Prasad. Shyam had impressed her truly with his compassion, love and faithfulness. She asks the court to acquit him of all charges as she knows that Shyam is not such a person. Annamalai feels flattered by Monika's points but still states that he is not Shyam Prasad. During a police raid, Ammu Kutty's jewels were recovered. When the owner was questioned, he said someone called Napoleon sold them to him; the owner gives the police the phone number. Using this, they captures Napoleon. In the court, Napolean reveals his real name as Thambidurai . He says he was a friend of the accused but never knew what was going on. He said that he was given some dialogues to speak and some numbers to contact and he did what he was asked. He also said that the accused also asked him to deposit Rs.20 lakhs to Anbu old age home. The police investigate at the old age home and finds that Annamalai is not the real son of Annapoorni but adopted. They also learn that it was this place that the money of Rs.20 lakhs quoted by Napoleon was found. The police conclude that Annamalai is Josef Fernandez and, hence, the culprit. However, before the police could bring the proof against Annamalai, the judge, assuming all witnesses have appeared, prepares to give the judgment. The court starts its final day of hearing, assuming there were no other witnesses to produce. Annamalai says that he is innocent of all charges and the real culprit, who looks exactly like him, is free. He also accuses the victims of being greedy and consenting to an apparently advantageous marriage without proper thinking. The judge delivers the final judgment on the case saying that, based on the evidences submitted, it can only be suspected that Annamalai is the culprit. But there is no clear proof against him and, hence, she judge acquits him on the benefit of doubt before the police can arrive and prove him guilty. She also denounces the hasty decisions taken by the women and Rekha's brother who had offered bribe to a government official, which had brought them into such a situation. Outside the court, Annamalai is stabbed by another woman who claims to have been cheated by him. He asks forgiveness from Jesus and collapses, revealing he is Josef Fernandez. He is rescued by an ambulance. The last scene is Annamalai in a foreign country, enticing yet another woman into marrying him.\"},\n",

Much to their disappointment, Gus and Jaq arrive just as the Fairy Godmother has finished the story. With the Fairy Godmother\\'s help, the mice set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the Happily Ever After, by stringing three segments of stories together into one narrative.  Cinderella is put in charge of the palace banquets and parties while the King and Prince Charming are away. However, the princess realizes she is dissatisfied with the way they are usually run, led by a sharp and snobbish woman named Prudence. With the help of his friends, Cinderella persuades everyone in the palace that everyone in the kingdom, including the commoners, should be allowed to participate in the next royal banquet and not everything has to agree with traditional ways. The mice add that story to the book as Jaq gets some magical help from the Fairy Godmother opening a bottle of ink. Proclaiming that he does not like \"that magic stuff,\" Gus reminds him of his last encounter with it. Looking to impress Mary, a mouse who Jaq loves, Jaq allows the Fairy Godmother to tell his story.  One of Cinderella mouse friends, Jaq, thinks he is too small to help Cinderella in the palace like he did in the first movie. The Fairy Godmother shows up to help him out, and turns him into a human so he can help out like everyone else. However, this does not stop Pom Pom, the palace\\'s snobby cat, who became the mice\\'s new nemesis as soon as they moved to the palace along with Cinderella, from chasing Jaq around. He is named \"Sir Hugh\", after coughing while trying to tell Cinderella that he is now human. After an incident with an elephant at a fair, he learns to be happy for who he is. It is also made evident that Jaq is in love with another mouse named Mary and that Pom Pom belongs to the same woman who was terrified of Jaq. One of the mice inadvertently spills magic dust onto the art supplies, causing them to become animated. The supplies begin to almost destroy the nearly completed book until the Fairy Godmother puts a stop to it.

Anastasia, Cinderella\\'s stepsister, falls in love with a kind but common baker, which her mother Lady Tremaine and older sister Drizella are not too happy with. They still want her to marry a rich man, and convince her to forget about the baker and say that everything in the baker\\'s shop is inferior; Anastasia ignores Tremaine\\'s warning. Meanwhile, Lucifer starts chasing Cinderella\\'s mice and Anastasia is kicked by a horse when she and the baker meet, and is mortified when she crashes into the baker\\'s shop. However, Cinderella finds out about Anastasia\\'s feelings and tries to push her and the baker together. During the process, Lucifer enters the palace and continues to chase Cinderella\\'s mice, but during the chase, he falls in love with Pom Pom despite her disliking him. The mice help their old nemesis fall in love with Pom Pom, that is, if Lucifer promises to stop chasing mice. When Lucifer and Pom Pom get together, Pom Pom goads Lucifer into breaking his promise and helping her catch the mice. In the ensuing chase, the mice push a bucket of water on Pom Pom, and she leaves Lucifer out of spite. The baker, meanwhile, asks Anastasia to the upcoming ball, which her mother and Drizella disapprove of. Anastasia stays with the baker and falls in love. The mice finish their book.

Upon conviction, his family is fined with $45,000 and he is banned from owning or operating computers or touch-tone telephones until his 18th birthday. Shortly before Dade  turns 18, his mother  takes a job in New York City. Upon turning 18, Dade calls a local television station, dupes the security guard into giving him the modem\\'s phone number (a tactic known as [[Social engineering  and successfully hacks into the station\\'s computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of The Outer Limits. However, Dade is \"attacked\" by a hacker  on the same network. During the conversation, Dade identifies himself by the new alias, Crash Override, to hide his old alias as Zero Cool. Dade enrolls at Stanton High School, where he meets Kate Libby , who is assigned to take him on a tour of the school. After Dade learns that Kate is \"Acid Burn\", they feud over who is the better hacker. The real trouble begins when Joey Pardella , the novice hacker of the group, successfully breaks into an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer  to prove to the rest of the group that he is an elite hacker. To validate this feat, he downloads part of a garbage file. Unfortunately, the company\\'s IT employee Hal  detects this unauthorized entry and summons computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford  to deal with the problem. He realizes the file being downloaded can prove that The Plague is stealing from the company via salami slicing. The Plague enlists the U.S. Secret Service to recover the file by claiming that it is the code to Da Vinci, a computer virus that will capsize the company\\'s oil tanker fleet and he needs that code to destroy the virus. Joey is arrested and his computer is searched, but the Secret Service finds nothing, as Joey has hidden the disk containing the files. In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a hacking duel, with hacks focused on harassing Secret Service Agent Richard Gill , a known enemy of hackers, who was involved in Joey\\'s arrest. Kate and Dade\\'s hacker friends—Ramon Sanchez a.k.a. \"The Phantom Phreak,\" Emmanuel Goldstein a.k.a. \"Cereal Killer\", and Paul Cook a.k.a. \"Lord Nikon\" —act as judges. After being released on parole, Joey reveals the disk to Phantom Phreak in a public park; but they quickly realize that they are being followed by the Secret Service. The next day, Phreak is arrested. He uses his phone call to inform Kate that he hid the disk in a boy\\'s bathroom at school. That evening, Kate and Cereal Killer ask Dade for his help; but, because of his record, he declines. Kate then asks Dade to copy the disk so that, if anyone else is arrested, they have the disk as evidence. After determining that Dade is not the one who hacked into Ellingson, The Plague attempts to enlist Dade\\'s help to find the one who did. First, he offers Dade a free high-powered laptop. Later, he threatens to have Dade\\'s mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate\\'s copy of the disk. Meanwhile, Kate, Lord Nikon, and Cereal Killer attempt to discern the contents of the disk. Dade joins them; and, after working all night, they learn the truth—it\\'s designed to salami-slice $25 million from Ellingson transactions. Dade reveals that he knows Plague is behind this scheme, because he was the one who wanted Kate\\'s copy of the disk. He admits he gave Plague the disk and reveals his history as Zero Cool. Determined to stop the scheme, the assembled hackers plan to hack the Gibson again. Kate and Dade go dumpster-diving for employee memos with passwords; Cereal Killer installs a hidden microphone in the Ellingson offices; and Nikon poses as a delivery boy wandering the Ellingson cubicles, memorizing employee passwords as they enter them. From the memos, they discover the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day, which would provide the perfect cover to distract from the salami-slicing worm. In need of help, they seek out Razor and Blade, the producers of a hacker-themed pirate TV show, \"Hack the Planet.\" The next morning, they evade the Secret Service and converge on Grand Central station, where they use payphones to begin their assault on the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to warn him to escape before he is arrested. However, Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support with virus attacks, distracting Plague long enough for Dade to download the incriminating file to a floppy disk. Shortly after crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. As they\\'re being led away, Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer, hiding in the crowd, that he\\'s tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam the local television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer, revealing the plot and Plague\\'s complicity. Plague is arrested when he tries to flee to Japan under the alias \"Mr. Babbage\" . Their names cleared, Dade and Kate go on a date. Kate even wears a dress. While relaxing in a pool on the roof of a building, their friends show off their latest hack—the lights in several adjacent office buildings spell out \"CRASH AND BURN.\"'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by Father Merrin following the horrific events he witnessed during World War II. Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Lankester Merrin  travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest. Near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After WWII, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church from about circa 500 A.D. — long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Merrin is asked by the collector to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but is diverted by the Vatican to ensure that the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the dig, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during WWII and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\\'s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure. Merrin visits the dig site, although only the dome is uncovered, with the rest of the church buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after the construction was completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is convention for statues of angels not to have weapons or for them to be pointed triumphantly to heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside position, which is considered a desecration. Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Merrin is told by Sarah that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\\'s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact that Merrin was asked to find by the collector. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\\'s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them. Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed. Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there. Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple — but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession  and Joseph . At the end of the movie, the dig\\'s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church,  and history has repeated itself. 50  years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, \"But you found something....Didn\\'t you?\"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.'},\n",

It opens with various shots of the Shaolin Temple, including the wall paintings, the many beautiful trees, gardens, shrines, gates, and statues of Buddha and the Gods. The temple bells toll as the monks kneel in the pillared inner sanctum and bow before the great altar of the Golden Buddha, before which sits the Abbot of Shaolin. A shaven-headed, blue-robed novice  stands with his palms pressed together and his head bowed. He is about to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot speaks to him of ceremony, purification, and learning to respect one\\'s self and others. Then the Abbot asks for his name. \"Jue Yuan\", he answers. The Abbot tells him that to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple, he must vow to not commit murder. He asks if he can obey this, but Jue Yuan is silent, staring downward. The Abbot repeats the question, and Jue Yuan slowly raises his eyes, gazing intensely at him. The Abbot asks the question a third time... The film flashes back to the warlord and deadly fighter Wang Shichong killing an old man with a throat lock and throwing him off a high brick wall into a muddy river, then abusively ordering the rest of his slaves back to work. They\\'re at a labor camp by the great river, toiling in the mud among corpses that hang from gallows as the soldiers whip them. It is during the rebellions at the end of the Sui Dynasty, when China became divided between various factions. Wang Shichong, who ruled from Luoyang, has treacherously installed himself as Emperor of the East Capitol, and is overseeing the bolstering of his riverfront defenses against the rival warlords on the opposite bank. They are near the Shaolin Temple. He forces even the old, crippled, and sick to work, but still the work isn\\'t progressing fast enough for him. He orders an officer to bring all his prisoners, who are opposing rebels, to join the slaves. These rebels include an older kung fu master, famous for his kicking skill, and his long-haired son, Jue Yuan. The soldiers whip the slaves, and one old slave collapses and drops a wooden beam, which causes an officer\\'s horse to rear and throw the officer. The officer begins to beat the slave to death, but Jue Yuan\\'s father attacks him, though his ankles and wrists are chained together. The officer proves to be a kung fu fighter, and they fight, but Jue Yuan\\'s father still manages to defeat him. This draws the attention of the Emperor, who attacks Jue Yuan\\'s father himself and rips his throat out with his bare hand. Jue Yuan rushes in and unleashes the kicking skills that his father taught him, scattering the guards and fighting the officers, but then the Emperor beats him up and deals him a deadly Dim Mak palm strike to the chest. Jue Yuan is thrown into the river, and he manages to swim away and escape. He staggers through the wild, dying of his wounds, but finally he manages to reach the Shaolin Temple. The Sifu  is teaching the monks staff kung fu when Jue Yuan arrives and falls unconscious. Throngs of refugees from the war-torn countryside are flocking to the Shaolin Temple every day. The Abbot proclaims that it is their holy duty as Buddhist monks to pray for the refugees and do all they can to help them. They nurse Jue Yuan back to health. When he has recovered, he joins them in carrying water from the river to the Temple, which they use as kung fu conditioning. He struggles, but is helped by a beautiful girl named Bai Wu Xia , who sings and herds rams in the beautiful wildlife-filled forested hills that surround the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan spies on the monks\\' kung fu training and gets himself into various other comedic misadventures around the Shaolin Temple, befriending the light-hearted, fun-loving, mischievous Sifu and his equally mischievous kung fu students in the process. One night they all sneak out to eat and party around a fire in the woods. There he learns more about the Sifu and his former family in the North. He learns that the Sifu is Bai Wu Xia\\'s father, that she was one of the main ones who nursed him back to health, and that she is skilled at kung fu. The Sifu says that nine years ago, he and his wife were being chased by the Emperor and his soldiers, and he left his wife with a farmer to hide while he fled on, eventually hiding in the Shaolin Temple. The farmer, who had no children, raped the woman, and it is implied that he also murdered her. Bai Wu Xia\\'s whereabouts during these events are not made clear. Jue Yuan declares that he will kill the Emperor, and he asks the Sifu to train him in his Northern Shaolin kung fu. The Sifu tells him that Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not killing, and besides, Jue Yuan isn\\'t a monk. Jue Yuan drops to his knees, presses his palms together, and says that he wants to become a monk. Jue Yuan’s head is shaven, and he bows before the Abbot of Shaolin on the great altar of the golden Buddha. The assembled monks sing mystic hymns, ring bells, and strike gongs. A mosquito bites Jue Yuan as he kneels there, and he kills it, but the Abbot blesses and accepts him, and he is ordained as a junior monk. Jue Yuan joins his fellow monks in Northern Shaolin kung fu training. After a time of at least several months he has gained impressive fighting abilities, but while sparring, his enemy flashes with the visage of the Emperor in his mind, and he almost kills his partner. He is banned from practicing kung fu. His emotions flare quickly out of control, and he runs away from the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan attempts to assassinate the Emperor, but fails and is forced to flee. Ashamed, he returns to the Shaolin Temple. His Sifu admonishes him, but welcomes him home and allows him to resume his Northern Shaolin kung fu training. Jue Yuan trains for at least another year, as seen in a ‘four seasons’ training sequence, and becomes highly adept at Northern Shaolin kung fu. Then another refugee comes fleeing to Shaolin, this one pursued by the Emperor and his men. This refugee is Li Shimin, son of a great leader who founded the Tang Dynasty, Li Yuan. The Shaolin monks keep peace with the Emperor and his men, and make a show of helping them hunt for Li Shimin. But Jue Yuan helps Li Shimin escape through the mountains, and Jue Yuan and Li Shimin end up hiding together in an abandoned ancient mountainous cave temple with many giant statues of Buddha and the Gods. Bai Wu Xia stealthily brings them food and water. Li Shimin must escape, though, so Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia help him, sneaking and bribing their way past the Emperor’s patrols in disguise. Throughout this time, a forbidden romance builds between Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia. But they fail in their clean escape, and Li Shimin and Bai Wu Xia flee on a raft down a river, Li Shimin with an arrow in his leg, while Jue Yuan sacrifices himself to slow down the Emperor’s outriders. However, his Sifu from Shaolin and a group of Shaolin warrior monks come to his aid and massacre the outriders. They save Jue Yuan’s life, but his Sifu excommunicates him from Shaolin for his acts and banishes him. He desperately follows them back to the Shaolin Temple anyway, but they throw him out and drive him away. The Emperor learns what the Shaolin monks did, and marches on the Shaolin Temple with his army to destroy it. Jue Yuan comes back yet again, and this time his Sifu sends him away along with Ba Wu Xia, to take her to safety and never return. The Abbot of Shaolin orders the monks not to fight, even while the Emperor’s army surrounds the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot treats with the Emperor. He appeals that the Temple has a very long history, and a crime should not merit the destruction of the buildings, or any of the monks. As the Abbot, he accepts the blame. The Emperor has him placed on a great pyre, which is set aflame. He tells the monks that if they reveal the traitors’ whereabouts, he’ll spare the Temple and the Abbot’s life. When no one talks, he has his men kill several of the other top monks, and threatens that if no one talks, they’ll all be killed. Then the Sifu and the warrior monks reveal themselves. The Sifu cries that they must fight. The Abbot, as he is immersed in fire, tells the Sifu to release the souls of the Emperor and his men and send them to Heaven. And so the battle is joined. Many monks are killed. Jue Yuan and Ba Wu Xia return to the embattled Shaolin Temple. The Emperor’s army takes the outer walls and outer grounds, and kills all the monks therein. The surviving monks fall back within the inner walls. The Sifu is shot full of arrows. He entreats Jue Yuan to protect Shaolin and uphold justice, and dies. The Emperor and his men break open the inner gate with a battering ram, and they’re about to massacre the rest of the monks, but then the Emperor receives word that Li Shimin and his army are approaching his own East Capital, and they abandon the siege of the Shaolin Temple and ride for the East Capital with all speed. Jue Yuan and the warrior monks ride after the Emperor and his men and join the battle at the ravaged East Capital, at the very site where the Emperor killed Jue Yuan’s father. Jue Yuan and the Emperor duel with swords and empty hands and feet on the shores of the great river. Their battle climbs up a great wooden structure, falls off the top into the river, and returns to the shore. Finally Jue Yuan uses his Northern Shaolin kung fu to kill the Emperor, and the battle for the East Capital is won. The film returns to its beginning, with Jue Yuan in the sanctum of the Shaolin Temple, kneeling before the high altar, as the new Abbot asks him if he can obey the vow to do no murder. Jue Yuan vows that he shall not kill save to uphold righteousness, and the Abbot accepts this. Jue Yuan continues to swear his vows, but when he reaches the vow of celibacy, he is again conflicted. He opens his folded palms to look at a jade amulet. He flashes back again. He and Bai Wu Xia kneel and bow before the shrine of the fallen previous Abbot, to whom they have offered many baskets of fruit and other foods. Jue Yuan speaks aloud to the Abbot of how he is determined to enter Buddha. Bai Wu Xia gazes at him with tears in her eyes, knowing what this means. Jue Yuan vows to defend Shaolin and uphold justice, quoting the last words of his fallen Sifu, Bai Wu Xia’s father. Bai Wu Xia gives him the jade amulet, a token of her love, and departs. Now, in the present, he looks up from the jade amulet to see Bai Wu Xia, who has snuck into the side wing of the sanctum and is staring at him from behind a great pillar. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves. The great bell of Shaolin tolls, and the gongs and drums are beaten as Jue Yuan is ordained as a true monk of Shaolin. The film’s closing scene is of Jue Yuan, now the new kung fu Sifu of the Shaolin Temple, leading the monks in their training.'},\n",

Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent\\'s article and sentenced to death. Superman asks Dr. Quintim to keep news of his impending death secret from the public. Wanting to spend as much of his remaining time with Lois Lane, Superman reveals to her that he is Clark Kent. Lois doubts his revelation because she had been unable to prove Superman\\'s \"Kent\" identity herself. Superman takes her to the Fortress of Solitude. During this visit, Superman\\'s secretive behavior and indirect exposure to alien chemicals heightens Lois\\'s paranoia. She is startled by Robot 7 shooting it and then Superman with a kryptonite laser. The solar radiation has made him immune to green kryptonite, Superman is able to calm her explaining his caginess was to hide her birthday present, a serum granting her superpowers for 24 hours. Now as a Superwoman, she and Superman stop an attack by Subterraneans in Metropolis just as Samson and Atlas arrive.

They followed the trail of the vessel that brought Superman to earth. To his dismay, the two have less altruistic goals and intend to turn Earth into a new Krypton.

He receives a letter from one of the most notorious criminals in Britain, the so-called Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, who is several years into her life sentence for taking part in the murder of three children with her boyfriend, Ian Brady. When he visits her, she asks for books but also for him to arrange for her to meet Brady. Longford is shocked and tells her that it would be in her own best interests to have no contact with Brady, as it might harm any future chances of parole. Hindley seems equally shocked at the idea that she would ever be allowed parole. Longford then begins his campaign for Hindley to be paroled. The question remains of whether Hindley is indeed reformed &mdash; for example, in her decision to convert to Longford's own Roman Catholic faith &mdash; or whether she is merely manipulating him and feigning her rehabilitation in an attempt to bring herself closer to release. Longford visits Brady twice; on both occasions, Brady tells him that she is manipulative and that he should turn his back on her. Longford, driven by his deep religious belief that all people are ultimately good, decides to continue on his course, despite heavy public, political, and family criticism and even though it turns out that Hindley has not been honest with him. In 1986 she reveals that she and Brady were responsible for two further murders. Even as Hindley's revelations sparked yet more public hostility towards Longford for trying to win her release, he remains loyal to Hindley and continues to back her campaign for release. He is last seen visiting her in prison in the late 1990s, by which time Longford is frail and more than 90 years old, while Hindley is still in her 50s but in a declining state of health.

              "  'plot': 'Episode 1: A New Life FormVajra>Vajra is a Sanskrit word meaning both thunderbolt and diamond. In Buddhism, the Vajra is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major branches of Buddhism, and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or bodhi as well as indestructibility . In addition to having almost unlimited strength and regenerative abilities, Genocyber also possess incredible telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers. After a brutal search by the scientist and his masked henchmen for Elaine that leaves dozens of corpses in its wake, Elaine is apparently captured by agents of a shadowy government organisation and the scientist is arrested. However, Elaine then uses her psychic power to merge with Diana and become Genocyber. In the ensuing battle, in which the scientist and government agents are killed, huge fires are started and numerous buildings are heavily damaged. The next morning, Elaine finds that her only friend, a young homeless boy she met before she was captured, has died after falling from a construction site. Elaine becomes filled with anger and screams, turning into Genocyber, and initiating a massive explosion which completely destroys Hong Kong, leaving only a barren wasteland in its place.  The second OVA apparently occurs shortly after this first one ended. A country called Karain The fictional country of Karain depicted in the OVAs appears to have no relation to the fictional continent of the same name in Austin Tappan Wright\\'s novel Islandia, or to Karain Cave, which is an Paleolithic archaeological site located in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.However, a map shown of Karain, combined with a statements that the country is surrounded by deserts on three sides  suggests that it is intended to be an analogy to the real-life country of Kuwait, which at the time, had been invaded by Iraq and was subject to an American-led UN offensive to against the Iraqi occupation forces in early 1991. has withdrawn from the United Nations in protest of the new World government and launched an invasion of a neighboring country. In response, the United States agrees to deploy a Carrier Strike Group to support offensive operations against Karain; this fleet will be led by the Alexandria, a massive futuristic Supercarrier, which is currently stationed off the coast of Japan. However, satellite photographs have identified an unknown superweapon believed to have been deployed by Karain . Concerned about the power of this new weapon, the United States military requests assistance from the Kuryu Group. Realizing that the image is in fact of Genocyber , the Kuryu Group agrees to send a team of its top scientists to the Alexandria. The Kuryu scientists, including the mentally unstable Sakomizu, bring on board their own secret weapon, a newly-created Vajra, out of anticipation that the fleet will encounter Genocyber. Unlike Genocyber, this new Vajra has a completely robotic body that enables it to almost literally fuse with any machine or weapon it operates. This is demonstrated when the Vajra fuses with a fighter aircraft, enhancing the fighter\\'s capabilities far beyond anything that would be possible for a human pilot. As the fleet travels from Japan to Karain, the Vajra is conducting a test flight in a fighter when a UN scout plane operating near Karain radios in and requests to make an emergency landing. The pilot also has aboard a civilian he rescued near Karain: Elaine. As the scout plane approaches the carrier, Elaine senses the Vajra, which in turn senses Elaine. Alarmed, the Vajras fighter veers wildly off-course in pursuit of the scout plane, entering into a steep dive and nearly crashing into the carrier. The scout plane is forced to make a crash landing on carrier deck, although Elaine survives unscathed. The carrier\\'s senior officers sharply rebuke Sakomizu for the Vajras strange behavior, yelling at him that his Vajra is not only dangerous, but is also uncontrollable.In the original Japanese version, the American officers rebuking Sakomizu refer to him using the racist term \"you goddamn Jap!\". In the English dub, this was changed to \"you stupid ignorant f#%@ing piece of s%#!.\" Later, Sakomizu yells at the Vajra for embarrassing him. Unlike in the previous OVA, Elaine now has a largely cybernetic body from the neck down. Although it is unclear why and how this change occurred, it is possible that Elaine and Diana  have merged. A young female doctor, Myra, takes Elaine under her protection and gives her the name Laura. To Myra, Laura/Elaine reminds her of her own daughter  who died in a plane crash several years earlier. Although Elaine is still mute, she is able to communicate telepathically with Myra, with whom she forms a special bond. Almost immediately, Myra comes to think of Laura/Elaine as her own child. Neither Myra nor the crew are aware of the girl\\'s psychic abilities and her presence on board is briefly uneventful. However, numerous members of the crew begin having nightmarish visions and several suffer mental breakdowns. Soon after, the Vajra again senses Elaine, and interprets her presence  as a threat to itself and the ship. Elaine also senses the new Vajra, and after seeking it out, transforms into Genocyber and destroys it, but Genocyber\\'s arm is hacked off during the fight. The ship\\'s crew, unaware of what actually happened, simply conclude that Sakomizu\\'s Vajra has malfunctioned again, and blame him for the incident in which several crewmembers are killed . However, Sakomizu, upon seeing his Vajra destroyed, is insulted and wrongly concludes that the crew sabotaged his work, although he now clearly suspects that Elaine is more she appears to be. He eventually creates a new Vajra after acquiring Genocyber\\'s severed arm but is unable to control it; the Vajra then expands throughout the carrier, engulfing and consuming the entire crew, except for Myra, whom Genocyber saves. Sakomizu also appears to survive initially, before he too is consumed by the Vajra. Genocyber then flies into the carrier and reaches the core of the Vajra. The Vajra attempts to fuse itself with Genocyber but Genocyber\\'s psychic powers prove to be stronger and the Vajra loses control of its body and the consumed carrier, which detonates in a massive explosion. Later, Myra is rescued by two Karain helicopter pilots as they investigate the remains of the American fleet. Deciding that Myra is delirious, they fly back to Karain, but are horrifed to discover that the entire country has been devastated and that the capital city is in flames. Genocyber then rises above the country and spreads its wings, confirming that Karain has suffered a similar fate as Hong Kong. The episode ends with Genocyber flying away, as Myra, who has been driven to near-madness by the events, yells \"It\\'s my daughter, Laura! She\\'s become an angel! Take me Laura! Take me away from this hell!\"  The third OVA is much different from its previous ones, taking place in a post-apocalyptic earth, in a region called the City of the Grand Ark. The young girl, Elaine , does not appear much in this episode, only a transparent image in the story. In this story, Genocyber eventually realizes that \"there was no place in the world for its power\" and is dormant until it reawakens at the end. In a brief opening scene, the now-extremly elderly leader of the Kuryu Group is seen looking at a wall of computer screens that show Genocyber on a rampage of destruction. It is revealed that for 100 years, humanity has been waging a desperate and hopeless war against Genocyber, which has decimated the Earth. The leader of the Kuryu Group vows to find someway to stop Genocyber, even if it takes centuries. However, Genocyber then attacks his location, and a massive explosion is seen to rise into the Earth\\'s atmosphere. The next scene, apparently set further into the future, shows a massive spacestation, possibly a colony ship, orbiting Earth. A computer monitor on board indicates that it is now the year 2400 AD. The story starts out in Ark de Grande City , one of the last remaining cities on earth, which is controlled by an evil mayor who claims that he is restoring the civilization that was destroyed by Genocyber, but only does this to gain trust from the civilians. The Mayor is ruthless, killing anyone who opposes him, and most of the city\\'s population a lives only as a labour class with few rights, while the mayor and an upper class live in luxury. The story shifts to a couple, Ryu and Mel, whom Ryu is trying to find a doctor good enough to cure Mel\\'s blindness. They arrive in Ark de Grande City but, as members of the lower class, are unable to get the medical help necessary to allow Mel to see again. Ryu and Mel attempt to earn money as performers, as Mel possesses an extraordinary ability to determine appearances, colours and numbers, even though she is blind. She describes her power as an ability to \"see the person\\'s form floating in my mind.\" She also has remarkable hearing and can often sense the environment around her. Ryu has an ability to throw knives while blindfolded, and hit targets with pinpoint accuracy. After Ryu and Mel make love that night, Ryu says that he hopes to earn enough money so that they can leave the city as soon as possible. Later, Ryu is recruited by a member of the upper class to perform at his establishment, promising a large sum of money. However, the man tricks Ryu  into throwing knives at a real person who is tied to a wall, killing him, much to the delight of the spectators. Realizing that he has been tricked, Ryu manages to escape but is now pursued by the city\\'s guards. While Ryu and Mel try to hide in the ruins beneth the city, Mel hears Elaine\\'s voice calling to her, and she and Mel find themselves in a ritual chamber with a seemingly fossilized head and torso of Genocyber at the centre of an altar. A flashback then shows Genocyber on its rampage of destruction. An image of Diana appears, and her voice then calls to Elaine, telling her that \"It has to end. We can\\'t stay in this world. We can\\'t use our power\" The two sisters then join hands and disappear, while Genocyber is seen lying on the ground, having seemingly been turned to stone. The scene shifts back to the present and to a shot of the massive spacestation orbiting the earth.  In a series of images, Mel is seen walking with Diana towards Genocyber\\'s broken body. An image of Elaine appears in front of Genocyber, and Diana screams. In a subsequent dream, Diana refers to Mel as \"big sister.\" The scene shifts back to Mel, who is taken in by the religious sect which opposes the Mayor. The sect believes that the destruction brought by Genocyber was a punishment from God, and believe that Mel is God\\'s messenger, who will prevent such destruction from happening again. Meanwhile, Ryu makes his way up to the surface, where he is detained and subject to brutal interrogation by the police, after which he is apparently declared brain-dead. As Mel worries about Ryu, it is revealed that she is pregnant with his child. Under orders to destroy anyone opposing the mayor, the city\\'s troops then attack the sect\\'s church, killing everyone, including  Mel, whose bullet-riddled body lies on the ground with the bodies of children surrounding her. In an apparent dream, Diana begs Elaine not to turn into Genocyber again, stating that \"Our power has no place in this world.\" Mel, who appears to be in some sort of cocoon, asks Diana for help, stating that if she dies, the child she is carrying will never be born. She also states that she wants the city destroyed. Diana warns that asking for such power will unleash Genocyber, but it is too late: Genocyber awakens as Elaine, Diana, and Mel amalgamate into a red version of Genocyber, one which is much larger than its previous form. As Genocyber emerges, monitors aboard the orbiting space station switch on and begin recording the event. Genocyber then attacks the city, killing the mayor, and then all of its citizens. Soldiers attempt to stop Genocyber, but their weapons prove useless, and they too are killed. By the time Genocyber\\'s rampage is over, the entire city has been left in ruins. As Genocyber rises into the sky, whole pieces of the city\\'s remains begin to tear away from the ground and rise into the air. Genocyber resurrects Mel and Ryu, and Mel is then torn from Genocyber; she and Ryu begin to slowly fall into the burning city. Genocyber then reverts to its earlier smaller form, and images of Elaine and Diana are seen superimposed against Genocyber as it ascends into the sky. Genocyber then flies into space and attacks the orbiting space station, whose defenses open fire on Genocyber, but with no effect. Genocyber breaks into the station and watches a repeating broadcast of Genichiro Kuryu, the former leader of the Kuryu group, ordering its forces to destroy Genocyber. Diana\\'s voice then calls to Elaine, and images of the girls superimposed against Genocyber are briefly seen before Genocyber begins to freeze itself and the entire space station. The station then falls out of orbit, and explodes as it enters the atmosphere. The last scene shows Mel, who is no longer blind, and Ryu, lying unconscious in the ruins of the city. As Mel opens her eyes, she hears Diana\\'s voice calling, \"Big sister...\", and the scene turns to the ruined body of Genocyber, and a baby is heard crying in the background. The screen the goes black, and several black and white images of Elaine and Diana as small children are seen as the closing credits begin. The ending of the OVA is vague; It is not known what happens to Ryu and Mel afterward, if there are any other survivors on Earth, if Genocyber is still alive, or if Elaine can still manifest herself as the girl seen in the first two OVAs.  Elaine: A young mute girl who seems to be innocent in appearance, but when merged with her less powerful counterpart, she becomes Genocyber, capable of mass destruction as seen in all three OVAs. Her friend was a young boy who devoted his self to protect her, but was unable to when the government agents killed him. This causes Elaine to completely wipe out Hong Kong. In the second OVA, Elaine is named \"Laura\" by a young doctor, Myra, who once had a daughter about that age but died in a plane accident  . Elaine is also proved to be superior to any Vajura in combat, including the one on the American carrier. Most of Genocyber\\'s attacks include fire and flames that are used as weapons. In the third OVA, Elaine appears much as in a dormant state, confined to her dream-like world with her older sister, Diana. It is not fully explained in the beginning, but is later revealed that both Elaine and Diana realized that their \"power wasn\\'t meant to be for this world\" and they decided to go into a state of \"seclusion\", only to be reawakened when Genocyber decides to destroy the City of the Grand Ark, killing everyone except for Mel and Ryu. Genocyber then flies into space and destroys an orbiting space station with Kyuru\\'s former leader on a screen, talking about the destruction of Genocyber. It is not known what happens to Genocyber afterward. It is implied through subsequent imagery that Elaine and Diana\\'s consciousnesses still exist within Genocyber, although it is unknown if Genocyber is still alive or if Elaine  can ever remanifest herself as the girl seen in the first two OVAs. In the Japanese version, both Elaine and Diana are voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu. Diana: Elaine\\'s older sister. She seems to have great power as well, but is almost nothing compared to her younger sister, as shown in part one of the OVA. Diana is quite jealous of her sister\\'s skills and abilities, which causes her to try to kill her sister several times, yet proves to be futile. She merges with Elaine in the first OVA after being dismembered, with Elaine consciously controlling the body, and does not appear again until the third OVA. Diana appears physically older than her twin sister, because her body is almost completely cybernetic, due to the fact she was born without use of her arms or legs. Genocyber: The complete hybrid of the two sisters, Genocyber is the ultimate biological humanoid weapon  who is seemingly immortal and is nearly omnipotent. It is considered a god by the underground sect. It fought with the Earth\\'s forces for 100 years, but after the two sisters realized their mistake in existing in the world, they lay dormant underground. Its original appearance is a {{convert}} green creature with two horns protruding from its head. It also has angel-like wings that appear to glow when it flies. Its second form is much larger, taller than a skyscraper, causing mass destruction within the City of the Grand Ark. Its full form is a dragon-like creature. Exactly how Genocyber was created from the bodies and souls of the two sisters remains a mystery. Although the two sisters possess strong psychic abilities, the story vaguely depicts Morgan Nguyen in the beginning trying to create a mandala to fortify his embryonic child. In addition to possessing incredible strength and resilience, Genocyber displays extremely powerful telekinetic and pyrokinetic abilities. Given its appearance and nature, Genocyber is most likely intended to be an man-made analogy to the Angel Of Death; and possibly a warning of the terrible consequences that can occur when humans attempt to use Synthetic biology to create weapons that are beyond their control. Kenneth Reed: Claiming to be Elaine\\'s and Diana\\'s father, he both supports them to become a hybrid strong enough to prove the power of Vajura. He is near succession when Elaine suddenly escapes. He eventually dies after being taken custody of the two government agents, smiling as he watches his creation bloom out in the world. Myra: A female doctor who only appears in the second OVA, who takes care of Elaine after she is rescued by a civilian plane. Myra is very protective of Elaine, especially when people push her around for her unusual animal-like behavior. Myra, eventually, survives the carrier\\'s explosion and is rescued by two Karain soldiers though her sanity is unwell and truly lost by that time. Mel: A beautiful and mysterious young woman who is blind and needs money for the operation to cure her, and obtains money by fortune telling with her amazing psychic abilities. She is very calm and timid, and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Ryu. When she takes refuge in the underground sect, they believe her to be the Messiah. She is depressed at the moment because of Ryu\\'s disappearance and her pregnant state. She eventually dies at one point in the third OVA, along with the entire underground sect, but then is brought back to life by Genocyber when she and the two sisters fuse together as she states in the hyperdimensional mandala scene, \"I want this city destroyed.\" She is cured of her blindness at the end. There seems to be some connection between her and Diana, since they constantly communicate in Mel\\'s dreams, whom Diana also calls, \"Big sister.\" Ryu: A handsome young man who is Mel\\'s boyfriend. He aids with helping Mel cure her blindness, but does not have enough money to do so. One day, he is to throw knives at a target to gain money. He accidentally kills a man and is pursued by the city\\'s government. He is eventually caught and put into custody. He is later shown unconscious at the end of the third OVA with Mel, who wakes up to find her dearest asleep. Genichiro Kuryu: The chairman of Kuryu, he was first introduced in the series as a young boy controlling a giant company. In the second OVA, he sends an attack on the country Karain by making the overall decision. In the third OVA, Genichiro has become an old man, fighting for over 100 years with Genocyber, which was all to no avail. He himself states, \"Who created you to give you so much power?\" He later appears in a screen in an outer-space object, repeating a phrase, \"destroy the target \" over and over again. The mysterious object was frozen by Genocyber itself and perhaps destroyed. Dr. Nguyen Morgan: Elaine and Diana\\'s true father. He was the first to come up with an idea to create a Vajranoid whose power was limitless, and tries to achieve this by testing his wife Tanya by creating a mandala to carry out his work. He was assisted by Kenneth Reed, who later wanted the credit of producing such a weapon, and eventually kills Morgan. The time and place of the birth of Elaine and Diana are unknown, but they were born after the explosion of the research center, with a surviving Tanya. Nguyen Morgan appears only in the flashbacks of the first and second OVA\\'s. Sakomizu: A scientist who wishes to surpass Morgan\\'s research and does this by also creating a vajranoid weapon.  He succeeds in creating a powerful Vajura, but is proved to be matchless when in combat with Genocyber. He eventually creates a second Vajura that was made from Genocyber\\'s severed arm when it was fighting his first vajura. Sakomizu becomes insane, as he turns the entire crew of the carrier Alexandria into part of the vajura. Sakomizu is also by this time controlled by the Vajura, only to be first attacked by Myra, and then killed by Elaine. He, like all scientists who studied in creating an ideal Vajura, died ironically in the end. Other characters: Government Agents 1, 2, & 3: These agents, 2 male, and one female, are sent by Headquarters in Tokyo to retrieve Elaine and Diana. These three agents are cyborgs who have no mercy, killing people on a subway train to keep their actions to capture Elaine secret. One is killed by Elaine\\'s power after they capture her, and the other 2 go insane during Genocyber\\'s rampage in Hong Kong, transforming into monstrous mechanical forms, multilating corpses, before fighting Genocyber and being destroyed Captain: Captain of the Alexandria. He is also eventually fused with the ship\\'s vajura, and dies in the end with the entire crew when Genocyber emits its great power. Grimson Rockwell: An evil mayor of the Ark de Grande who is a hypocrite, and kills anyone who opposes the law. He dies near the end when Genocyber throws his parade car into a building.'},\n",

As precaution the Guardians of the Universe decide to evacuate Oa of all valuables, such as the Central Battery. While in line to charge their rings before the Battery is taken away, Green Lantern Corps rookie Arisia Rrab converses with Hal Jordan and expresses her selfdoubts as the newest Green Lantern. In response, Hal tells her the story of the first Green Lantern:  Avra, a scribe to the Guardians, is chosen by one of the first four power rings despite having no skill as a warrior. Avra and the other three original Green Lanterns are sent to stop a nation of warring aliens. One of the four Lanterns is killed and, with defeat at hand, Avra uses his willpower and imagination as a writer to continue the battle. He creates the first construct from his ring, a sword, that is used to decimate the alien war crafts. Taking Avra’s lead the other two Lanterns also create shapes from their power rings to win the fight. Thanks to Avra the war is won and the power to shape constructs from the power rings is discovered. Avra rises in prestige among the growing Green Lantern Corps, and after his death his ring is passed down until it eventually becomes Abin Sur's and then Hal Jordan's. Back in line at the Central Battery, Hal and Arisia meet Kilowog, the head trainer of the Green Lantern Corps. He antagonizes Arisia as a rookie and reminds her that she still has boot camp. Hal tells Arisia not to fear Kilowog and relates the story of Kilowog's own trainer.  Sgt. Deegan trains a rookie Kilowog and others by removing their power rings and putting them in deadly settings. Kilowog confronts Deegan and accuses him of a reckless training method and having no value for the lives of his trainees. Sgt. Deegan is then called to act with his recruits when a nearby planet comes under attack. Deegan purposefully drops Kilowog’s ring before departing with the other recruits. In the battle Sgt. Deegan orders the rookies to protect the refugees as he deals with the invaders. As Kilowog catches up, Sgt. Deegan is mortally wounded. Kilowog destroys the army and goes to Deegan's side. Deegan tells Kilowog he never would have let his rookies die and that he did what was best for their training. He passes superiority to Kilowog who then takes up completing the mission. Hal and Arisia arrive at a border patrol of the sun and await Krona's return. Arisia meets a Lantern named Laira and Hal shares her story:  Once a princess, Laira is sent on her first solo mission to her homeworld to deal with charges that her people are attacking other nations unprovoked. Standing in her way, Laira quickly defeats her father's mistress and her belittling brother. But when she faces her father she is saddened to learn that the recent war crimes were his own decision. He has been driven into rage by the loss of honor that Laira's ring chose her and not him. Laira is ultimately able to defeat her father who admits she has truly earned her adulthood. He then commits ritual suicide to maintain his honor. Back at the border patrol of Oa's sun, every Lantern has been called to await Krona's return. The only absent Lantern noted is Mogo. Hal explains who Mogo is and why he is not present:  Bolphunga the Unrelenting seeks to fight and destroy all the most powerful warriors in the universe and is told he will never defeat the Green Lantern Mogo. Bolphunga’s computer contains no stats on Mogo except his whereabouts on a mysterious green planet. There Bolphunga spends weeks tracking Mogo's power signatures but never finds the elusive Lantern. Bolphunga sets explosives all over the planet to flush Mogo out but is horrified when the planet extinguishes all the bombs and Mogo is revealed to be the entire planet. At Oa's sun Hal and Arisia are attacked by Krona's Shadow Demons and rescued by Sinestro. Sinestro then speaks of the prophecy that Oa will be destroyed and relates a story of Abin Sur and the Lantern view on destiny:  Hal Jordan's predecessor Abin Sur fights Atrocitus, an alien criminal speaking dark prophecies. Abin Sur is assisted by Sinestro in capturing the alien. Sinestro and Abin Sur then have a conversation relating to the warnings that Atrocitus spoke and Sinestro insists that he does not believe in destiny. Parting ways, Abin Sur takes the criminal to a prison planet where Atrocitus again speaks on Abin Sur's imminent death. He also warns Abin that Sinestro will rise against the Green Lantern Corps and create his own lantern corps built on the power of fear. Abin Sur however refuses to believe his friend would betray his Green Lantern duties.  Krona finally arrives from the Oa Sun. All the Green Lanterns fight swarms of Shadow Demons as Krona, an enormous figure, rises from the sun. Many Green Lanterns are killed and all others fall back. It is Arisia who devises a plan: if Krona is made of anti-matter then an equal or greater amount of matter will destroy him on contact. The Green Lanterns fall behind the planet Oa and push it at Krona. Krona uses Shadow Demons to push back and the Corps finds itself stymied while taking casualties. However, Mogo the Living Planet arrives and uses its own mass and Lantern Power to assist his comrades. Oa and Krona are forced into the sun and both are annihilated. The prophecy of Oa's destruction is fulfilled, but Krona is destroyed and the Corps is saved. Mogo volunteers to be the Corps' temporary base as they build a new Oa. Arisia is honored with an official entry into the Book of Oa for her heroic ingenuity, although she still has to report for Kilowog's training.\"},\n",

Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks. First, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happens, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude Cat. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting. Claude then takes the bottle of catnip he had hidden in an overhead lamp and tosses it out the window then he mutters. With the logs removed from the fireplace, Hubie lowers Bertie and a dog  in a doghouse down the chimney. While the dog is sleeping, Bertie pulls out the dog\\'s lower lip such that it snaps back on him, but not before Bertie is pulled back up the chimney. Seeing only Claude, the dog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney.

While Claude is in the bathroom, Bertie then inserts a lit firecracker into Claude\\'s pillow, which blows up not after he returns to it.

Next, Bertie returns down the chimney and runs a piece of string throughout the house, out of it into a water catch drain, down a ladder, and then back into the house, with the other end of the string attached to a rock on top of the chimney. Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude\\'s tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy. Claude then reads \"Psychology of Dreams\" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling  and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor . Claude is surprised when he grabs a bottle of nerve tonic, only to open it and see it \"rise\" to the floor. Claude then becomes confused when he enters into the kitchen, where everything is still right-side up. Further driving Claude mad is when he looks out one window where an illusion is given to make Claude think he is upside down, and then looks out another to make him think he is sideways, and then out a third to make him believe that the house is under water. Finally broken, Claude runs, screaming, from the house and hiding into a nearby tree. Having accomplished their mission, Hubie and Bertie return down the fireplace, and roast cheese over an open fire as the cartoon fades out.'},\n",

The two meet for the first time, when Ben visits his friend, the actor George Raft, on a movie-studio set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay while his wife and two daughters remain in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Siegel is in California to muscle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna\\'s office one day, and is confronted by Siegel. Dragna claimed losses of $56,000; Cohen admits to robbing $42,000. Siegel theorizes he should be in business with the guy that did the robbery, not the guy that got robbed. Mickey Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Jack Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Ben, that Jack stole $14,000 from the New York Associates, and is told he now answers to Cohen. A humiliated and degraded Jack Dragna leaves the house. \"Everybody needs a fresh start,\" says Ben, to the departing Dragna. A suddenly quiet Ben Siegel returns to the dinner table to eat his cold scampi. After having had an earlier argument about Virginia\\'s sexual trysts with drummer Gene Krupa, and a variety of bull fighters, Virginia makes a romantic move on Ben, in the dining room. On a trip to Nevada to visit a dive gambling joint, Siegel comes up with the idea for a casino in the desert. He acquires funding from head mobster Meyer Lansky  and other New York mobsters who approve the deal for $1 million. The funds are approved when the associates make an unannounced visit to Siegel at his Scarsdale, New York Home. Ben is caught in the middle of preparations for his daughter Milllicent\\'s birthday celebration. His wife, Esta, is full of marital frustration; Daughter Millicent feels abandoned on her birthday; Associate Meyer Lansky is conflicted between wanting to fund Ben\\'s Casino-Hotel and worrying about Ben\\'s obsession with wanting to kill Mussolini. Bugsy puts Virginia in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada, but has no sense of control and the budget soon rises to $6 million. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets made, even selling his share of the casino and most of his belongings. Bugsy returns to the East Coast for the party for Charlie\\'s trip to Italy. Charlie says \"Congratulations Ben. Virginia will make a great wife. But I hope you know what you\\'re doing.\" Bugsy pummels Joey A. at the party, for a previous insult made regarding Virginia. Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has ratted out his old associates to save himself. Harry has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits, and being extorted by the prosecutors who want his testimony. Ben is Harry\\'s last and only friend. We don\\'t see Ben kill Harry, but there is a gunshot, while Virginia waits in the car. Ben and Esta are out to dinner in a restaurant with their two daughters. Ben suggests that maybe the anticipated move to California is not such a good idea. Esta and Ben have a confrontation in the women\\'s restroom, away from earshot of the children. \"You want a divorce! Say it!! You want a divorce!\" Esta screams in Ben\\'s face, slapping him several times. Ben has a guilty look on his face, as he watches their cab drive away from the restaurant. Bugsy is arrested for Harry Greenberg\\'s murder. But incarceration is short. The only witness is a cab-driver who dropped off Harry in front of Ben\\'s Beverly Hills house. The cab driver is escorted to the train station by Mickey Cohen. Meyer is waiting for Ben outside the jail. Meyer has a satchel of money that he gives to Ben. \"Charlie doesn\\'t have to know about it,\" he tells Ben. But he also tells Ben, \"I can\\'t protect you anymore.\" Upset about the costs, the fact that the casino is a failure, and that $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, Meyer Lansky asks Bugsy to meet him in Los Angeles. Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money but tells her to \"keep it and save it for a rainy day\" rather than return it. He then calls Lansky and tells him never to sell his share of the casino and that he\\'ll live to thank him someday. While in his home back in L.A. later that night, Bugsy is killed by several gunshots. Virginia is told the news back in Las Vegas and becomes upset, rushing out of the casino. The final text before the credits states that she returned the missing money a week later and committed suicide at some point after that. It also states that by 1991 the $6 million invested in Bugsy\\'s dream of Las Vegas had generated revenues of over $100 billion.'},\n",

A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director  known as The Boy Wonder has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style  for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway. On the morning of this particular shoot, he hires a heroin-addicted waitress, Harlene , who was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while The Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood.

Miyagi is then introduced to Pierce\\'s granddaughter, Julie  an angry teenage girl who is full of pain, sorrow, and resentment because of the death of her parents in a car accident. Her anger and violent behavior have led to friction between her, her grandmother, and fellow students.

Hoping to mend matters, Miyagi invites Louisa to his own house in California to spend time enjoying peace and quiet tending his garden while he stays in Boston and appoints himself as Julie\\'s caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends Eric McGowen , a kindhearted security guard in training and a pledge for a shady school security fraternity known as the Alpha Elite. The members of this organization are taught to strictly enforce the school rules, even using physical force if necessary, by a vicious mentor, Colonel Dugan . In this group is Colonel Dugan\\'s strongest and most aggressive student Ned , who makes repeated, indiscreet, bullying and unsuccessful sexual advances on Julie. Eric learns of Julie\\'s hawk, Angel and promises to feed and water it while Julie is with Miyagi. When Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a tiger position, she reveals to Miyagi that she was taught karate by her father who learned from her grandfather who was trained by Miyagi. The next time she sneaks into the school to feed her bird, she is detected by the Alpha Elite,and chased through the school. Julie hides in the cafeteria until Ned finds her. when she ran up the cafeteria stairs and Ned grabbed her leg. She hits a fire alarm with her backpack, causing Ned to let go of her.

At the monastery, Julie learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life. She befriends several monks including the Grand Abbot. Eventually, the monks hold a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Miyagi had caught while it was in flight in a demonstration of Zen archery. Upon Julie\\'s return to school, she finds that Angel is now able to fly, and is assisted by Miyagi in releasing her back to the wild. In preparation for the upcoming school prom, Miyagi then teaches Julie how to dance and also buys her a prom dress. While Julie goes to the dance with Eric, Miyagi and the Buddhist monks go bowling. A boastful and undisciplined local player challenges them, loses the match, and accepts their tutelage. Meanwhile, at the prom, under the orders of Colonel Dugan, the Alpha Elite bungee jump into the dance. When one of the members breaks his arm Ned angrily tells Eric to mind his own business. Eric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them and damages Eric\\'s car with a baseball bat. Ned then challenges Eric to a fight at the docks, a favored Elite hangout. At the fight, Ned is joined by Colonel Dugan and the rest of the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric\\'s car, and severely beat him. Dugan disturbingly tells them to \"finish it\". Before they can, Eric is saved by Julie and Miyagi. As they prepare to leave, Ned provokes Julie, who challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, until Ned cheats by throwing sand in her face. Despite her disadvantage, Julie defeats Ned and turns her back on him. This prompts Colonel Dugan to desperately bully the rest of his group, urging them to continue the fight. Miyagi then challenges Colonel Dugan to fight.

              "  'plot': 'Ricky Bobby  is a NASCAR driver who was born to go fast, and is raised solely by his strict Christian mother, Lucy , while his drunk and alcoholic father, Reese , is absent. When Ricky was only ten years old, Reese shows up during Career Day at Ricky\\'s school, but after giving his vulgar speech, Reese was thrown out of the school. Before leaving, Reese told Ricky: \"If you ain\\'t first, you\\'re last!\", a quote that Ricky commits to memory. Fifteen years later, while working as the pit crew of Dennit Racing driver Terry Cheveaux  at the beginning of the film, Ricky replaces him and ends up finishing in third place, despite starting mid-race in last place. Ricky quickly soars to the top of NASCAR by achieving fame and fortune at Dennit Racing and meeting his future wife, Carly . Ricky eventually manages to allow Dennit to field an additional car to the field and arranges to have his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr.  on his team. While he and Cal are on top of the racing world, Ricky is challenged by his rival and homosexual French Formula One driver, Jean Girard , who outperforms Ricky on the track and becomes Dennit Racing\\'s next top driver. Desperate to regain his dominance, Ricky pushes himself too hard during the race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and ends up going airborne and his car lands upside down. While paramedics attempt to take Ricky to the hospital, Ricky ends up running around on the track in his helmet and underwear to think that he is on fire. While recovering from his injury, Ricky persists in the belief that he is paralyzed, which he certainly is not, a fact that Ricky only realizes after accidentally sticking a knife in his leg while trying to prove that he is paralyzed. Ricky\\'s tests at Rockingham Speedway shows that he has lost his touch and fails to regain a spot on his team. Carly, yearning to be married to another top NASCAR driver, plans to marry Cal before Ricky returns to his old home that evening. Cal invites Ricky to his wedding to Carly, but his invitation was immediately refused by Ricky, who accuses Cal of damaging his life. Ricky takes his two sons, Walker and Texas Ranger  to his old home and takes his old job as a pizza delivery boy, but is reduced to using a bicycle and riding the bus after accidentally losing his license for crashing his pick-up truck into a customer\\'s shopping cart and into the Sheriff writing Ricky a ticket for the previous incident. With Ricky\\'s life at its lowest point, Reese suddenly re-enters Ricky\\'s life and attempt to teach Ricky to drive by using unusual methods to get Ricky back to normal speed. With his retraining and the guidance of Reese, Ricky finally regains his confidence, but is taken back when Reese walks out on him once again. Reese leaves Ricky with the knowledge that the mantra around which Ricky originally used during his childhood years was in fact meaningless. When Ricky runs into his assistant, Susan  at a bar, she convinces Ricky to return to NASCAR not because of his desire to live up to the expectations of those around him, but because of his nature to drive fast. With Ricky heeding Susan\\'s advice to race at the Talladega 500, he and Susan fall in love with each other. Ricky manages to make amends with Cal, Girard, and Carly before the start of the race. Because his pit crew chief and close friend, Lucius Washington  has rebuilt his engine from spare parts donated by other independent drivers, Ricky is forced to start the race from the back of the starting grid. In no time, Ricky manages to pass all the other drivers except Girard. Heading towards the final laps, Cal receives orders from Dennit to get Ricky out of the race, but Cal refuses and instead pulls ahead of Ricky, which allows Ricky to slingshot around Cal and ends up in the lead along with Girard. On lap 182, the replacement driver of Ricky\\'s Wonder Bread car runs into Cal on Dennit\\'s orders, causing a massive wreck that wrecks every driver except Ricky and Girard. On the final lap of the race, Ricky and Girard end up making contact with each other and sommersault down the front straightaway heading towards the finish line. Determined not to give up, Ricky and Girard sprint their foot to the finish line. Although Ricky wins the foot race, he and Girard are disqualified for getting out of their cars, and Cal officially wins Talladega 500 by default, having been in third place at the time of the wrecks. Ricky and Cal finally reconcile their friendship and family. Ricky later meets up with Reese, Lucy, Susan, Walker, and Texas Ranger in the parking lot to reunite for a dinner party during which Ricky and his extended family plan to get thrown out of Applebee\\'s, referring to an earlier scene where Reese and Ricky leave each other again. A final scene during the closing credits finds Cal and Lucius working as NASCAR mechanics fixing Ricky\\'s car.'},\n",

Tom hates New York and reluctantly accepts, but largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family\\'s secrets.

It is clear that the narration is a poem, which the poet is typing on a typewriter. In the beginning, we are introduced to his city\\'s love of music and musical prowess. The poet singles out one female singer of whom he is clearly enamored, quoting her singing as \"A voice that made all the angels of eternity sound ... tone deaf\". Shortly afterwards we are introduced to an overbearing structure beyond the sea, appearing to be a lighthouse. Its light quickly goes out, foreshadowing malevolence. Singers and musicians begin to disappear into thin air, \"Like sailors lost at sea\". As police investigate the missing cats, they find human shoeprints. The main character begins to explain the Cat Piano and its terrible function. We are informed that the Cat Piano is an instrument, much like any ordinary piano or harpsichord. The terrible reality is that instead of using strings and hammers to produce the desired noise, the Cat Piano produces noise by striking a nail into the tails of one or more cats that are caged in the piano. Immediately after discovering this, the main character rushes to warn the female singer, and arrives seconds too late. His heart broken, the city falls to pieces around him, fights break out, and music becomes forbidden. For a short while, the poet is tortured of thoughts of The Cat Piano, and can\\'t get the sounds of screaming cats out of his head. He motions shooting himself with his hand, and with the word \"Snap\", we are shown a glimpse of what appears to be a nightmare. In this nightmare, a dark humanoid figure holds up a cage with the afformentioned female singer and pricks her with a needle. The poet wakes up in a cold sweat and decides to take action. He observes the lighthouse from a hill, which now casts a red beam of light, and he can hear the terrible screams of the cats from a distance. A makeshift army of the city\\'s citizens is shown behind him. He and the army head over to the lighthouse in boats, and upon their arrival begin to scale the lighthouse. They break into the lighthouse, and we are given a glimpse of the mad pianist. The instrument he is playing resembles more of an organ than a piano, but nevertheless it is a terrifying torture machine equipped with hundreds of needles. The poet meets eyes with the singer, who is placed at the very top of the organ. The man playing the organ turns around, and the army of cats attacks him. They bite, scratch, and claw at him until he stumbles out of a window and falls to his death. They free the imprisoned cats, set fire to the lighthouse, and leave with the prisoners for home. The mood immediately becomes lighthearted again, as the city regains its artistic merit. The poet is sure to point out that he is no more famous or revered as he was before the incident - just an \"anonymity\". He is just glad to be able to listen to the sounds of music coming from the streets. As he finishes his typing, just before the story ends, the singer he was enamored with is seen in his room. She walks over to him and affectionately strokes his chin, implying a happy ending for the poet.'},\n",

One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies a power struggle erupts between brutal Staff Sergeant Williams , humane Staff Sergeant Harris , Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson , and the camp\\'s Medical Officer  as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles. Roberts  is a former Squadron Sergeant Major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his Commanding Officer - which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams brutality and serves as challenge to his authority. The RSM is a career soldier who sees his vital task as breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again, in his words, \"into men!\" Staff Sergeant Williams is new to the prison, and his ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. \"And what are you supposed to be,\" Roberts asks him when he is accused of cowardice in battle, \"a brave man in a permanent base job?\" The RSM seems to agree; in another scene, he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK  just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathizes with the men, too closely, according to the RSM. The officers of the piece, both the CO  and the Medical Officer, take their duties casually and, as Roberts points out, \"everyone is doing time here, even the screws.\" In the finale, the camp\\'s Medical Officer and Staff Sergeant Harris decide to report the abuses at the camp. Sadistic Staff Sergeant Williams goes to administer one final, perhaps fatal, beating to Sergeant Major Roberts, when two prisoners intervene and appear to beat Williams to death while Roberts pleads with them to stop.'},\n",

Despite their best efforts, the Sand Ninja are slowly overwhelmed by the sheer strength of their mysterious opponents. The timely arrival of reinforcements led by Kankuro and Gaara turns the tide, with Kankuro slicing apart a suit of armor with his puppet, and Gaara dispatching a large number of enemies en masse with his signature Desert Imperial Funeral. However when Gaara orders the Sand Ninja to shine a flare at the retreating enemies, a large warship appears. The movie stars Naruto Uzumaki, Shikamaru Nara, and Sakura Haruno as they deliver a lost pet ferret  to its village. However, a mysterious knight called Temujin intercepts them and they fight, causing both Temujin and Naruto to be knocked off a cliff by the massive power caused by Naruto\\'s Rasengan and Temujin\\'s Rising Thunder. As Shikamaru and Sakura realize what has happened to Naruto, a giant ship appears. Naruto wakes up to find himself bandaged and traveling in a caravan led by Kahiko and Emina. He also finds Temujin asleep beside him. When Temujin awakens, Nerugui  seems to be attracted to him. The caravan is part of a moving country. Meanwhile, Sakura and Shikamaru split up to search for Naruto. Shikamaru spies on the fortress and finds a lab with children in capsules. Two women with similar armor to what Temujin was wearing are talking about the Gelel Stone. After watching the process, Shikamaru realizes that the soldiers are being created by placing the souls of children in different bodies. The movie revolves mostly around a special mineral called the Gelel Stone, which has a strong and mysterious power. There was once a clan that could control the stone\\'s powers , but they were destroyed because of fights for the stone. Temujin is working for his Lord, Master Haido, who has his group searching for the Stones of Gelel, so that he can create a \\'utopia\\', a world free from war and strife. But he also tells his group that sacrifices are for the greater good. When Naruto meets Haido, he at first believes him. Naruto accompanies Temujin, Ranke, and Fugai to the area where the fight between the Sand Ninjas and Haido\\'s forces took place. During the fight, Kamina duels with Kankuro while Ranke fights Gaara. When Ranke is killed by Gaara, Kamina escapes. The caravan that Naruto was saved by has been attacked as Fugai threatens Kahiko for the location of the Stones of Gelel. Shikamaru and Sakura end up repelling her. Temujin learns that Kahiko knows where the Stones of Gelel are. When he tries to capture Kahiko, he is subdued by Shikamaru\\'s Shadow Possession Jutsu as Naruto catches up. Shikamaru interrogates Temujin about Haido\\'s plot. After Shikamaru manages to get some answers, Temujin uses a smokescreen and kidnaps Kahiko and one of the children from the caravan. Temujin forces Kahiko to lead him to a cave where the stones are sealed away. Naruto follows him to try to stop him with Nerugui leading the way. Temujin sends the kid he abducted on his way as he has Kahiko lead him into the cave. But Haido, Fugai, and Kamina also follow him to the cave. This leads to a confrontation between Haido and Naruto\\'s group as Naruto finally realizes Haido\\'s evil intentions. He is disgusted that Haido and his followers are willing to sacrifice their friends and other innocents for their cause. He angrily yells that dreams that sacrifice friends are nothing but garbage, surprising Temujin. Kahiko triggers a mechanism that takes himself and Temujin to the chamber below, where the entrance to the mines of Gelel are, with the intent to destroy them. Haido angrily follows with several armed soldiers after smacking Naruto aside. Kamina challenges Shikamaru, and Sakura challenges Fugai before the latter can follow Haido with the ship. Naruto follows after Kahiko, Temujin, and Haido. Once there, Haido reveals that he has a piece of Gelel Stone which he uses to attack Kahiko. Eventually Temujin, surprised by Haido\\'s cruel words and behavior, defends Kahiko, which angers Haido. Eventually Naruto shows up and saves Kahiko. Temujin is finally so appalled by Haido\\'s willingness to kill Naruto and Kahiko and call it a \"noble sacrifice\" that he refuses to kill them when Haido orders him to. He realizes that the shadowy figure he had seen in the ruins of his house after his parents\\' death was Haido. Haido then admits that he was the one that killed Temujin\\'s family and then used their son like a pawn for all those years. He then attacks Temujin and destroys his piece of Gelel Stone by shoving his hand into his body, tossing him aside and leaving him lying on the ground, weak and horrified by what he has done. At this point Naruto intervenes and attempts to defeat Haido. Naruto manages to hit Haido with his Rasengan,which blasts him into the ceiling. But the ceiling starts to leak chakra from the Mines of Gelel and heal Haido\\'s wounds. Haido then shoots a blast of chakra at Naruto and Temujin which is blocked by some soldiers who were Temujin\\'s old friends. Naruto then creates a rasengan in one hand, and Temujin makes one in the other, which combined kill Haido. Haido crashes into the key to the mines of Gelel which causes a chain reaction which begins to destroy the surrounding area. Kahiko says the only way to stop the destruction is to summon a space-time rift to destroy the mines of Gelel and the summoner. Temujin offers to do it and begins to walk towards a summoning spot, ignoring Naruto\\'s words. When the space time rift is summoned, Naruto attempts to pull Temujin out and saves him. Naruto was thinking about what happened to Sasuke and did not want history to repeat itself. Later, Temujin leaves with the other children stating that he will end all war. Kahiko is sad that Nerugui is going with Temujin. The credits show Naruto and Temujin seeing each other one last time as Temujin\\'s ship leaves and make fists of victory.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The film begins with Bobby finding a winning lottery ticket, that Mike  insists must be returned to its rightful owner. Mike invites people over to his house to determine the rightful owner by posting an add in the newspaper stating \"lost & found winning lottery ticket for 67 million dollars.\" Naturally many people showed up but the original owner had written something on the back of the ticket giving Mr. Brady a way to tell who was telling the truth. With no one being able to come up with the phrase written, Mr. Brady starts to think of another way, and just as he says he doesn\\'t know what to do, a local female news caster walks in, and Mr. Brady sees it as a way to reach more people. Multiple cut scenes ensue showing stations talking about the Bradys trying to find the original owner, while also showing a broadcast talking about the vice president resigning to work for the company Fox, where he\\'ll make six times the amount he was making, in the background it shows the actual owner walking to his death by execution -this is implied by the man being in chains, escorted by law enforcement dressed people, and a clergy man speaking to him, while the man shouts, \"Wait, I\\'m the real owner, I\\'m rich, take your hands off me.\" With not being able to find the original owner Mr. Brady donates the money to \"homeless architects and their families\", which garners the attention of the president. The president then invites him to a press conference where the president is asked about his dealings with an oil drilling company abusing the environment, the president responds by saying he has never heard of the company, has not dealt with them, nor has he been to the site, where he then states, \"This is the truth or I shall resign my presidency.\" The press then goes on to ask if he has picked a new running mate for the upcoming election, and with the light of ongoing scandals can he find an honest man of high integrity. Carol, Mike Brady\\'s wife, shouts out why not Mike, where then the press shouts, \"Yeah, why not Mike,\" and the president says, \"Why not Mike Brady.\" It then cuts to a news station stating that the incumbent president and Mike Brady have won the election -with Mike Brady the vice president- due to boy scouts, disco music lovers, and polyester enthusiasts. The next scene in which the incumbent president and Mike are to be sworn in, a confidential document folder is passed to the incumbent president. The folder contains a picture of the incumbent president at the drilling site, with -what is inferred- the oil company\\'s top executives, the president remembering his promise then walks out before being sworn in, thereby making Mike Brady president. Mike Brady then needs to select a new vice president, which he decides it should be his wife. He goes before congress asking for a vote, where the speaker of the house says, \"You cannot just call for a vote, the vice president has very real responsibilities and cannot vote unless he sees something to prove she can do it.\" Carol then breaks out in song along with the rest of the family, convincing congress to vote for her. As Mike Brady is walking to the oval office different departments come to him with negative scores asking for more money or negligible increases asking for money, with which he replies, \"Not good enough\" including when his youngest daughter asks for him to sign her report card, although approving the congress\\'s new budget plan. Veronica, the liaison to the American public pulls the speaker of the house into a separate room, saying, \"Can you believe him, he just approved your budget, he\\'s not taking any credit, and he\\'s of to much integrity, how did he get to the highest office, you should be president.\" A side plot is Peter breaking a priceless Ming vase, and trying to get out of it by gluing it back together. Peter really wants to go to a camp, but feels if he tells the truth he won\\'t be able to go. The vase is used during a diner party with dignitaries across the world, but ends up leaking all over them. Peter\\'s siblings come up with the plan of all of them confessing, hoping to fool/confuse Mike Brady into not knowing who actually broke it. Mike thinking about it logically though realized Peter was the only one not to confess thereby showing his own guilt. Mike coming up with the consequence of punishing the other children forcing Peter into a guilt trip to confess his own guilt, ultimately succeeding. Veronica, Greg\\'s crush is later to be found as an agent of an elitist organization who\\'s mission is seizing power for herself and the speaker of the house. They both devise a plan to ruin the presidents image, and therefore presidency The first plan consisting of Veronica seducing Greg into divulging crude or malevolent information, on Mike or the family, fails, but the youngest daughter does give information regarding a questionable relationship between Mike Brady and a woman from his past; Carol is accused of rebellious behavior from protesting to keep a park; Marcia is accused of being promiscuous because of a fictional erotic encounter with Desi Arnaz Jr. written in her diary; Greg accused of under age smoking because of a cigaret container found in his coat, he had switched with another boy; Peter accused of bribery for getting a better grade after calling his teacher great; Jan accused of cheating for getting a better grade on an essay than she was supposed to; and Alice accused of drugging the food so the Bradys stay happy all the time. Although this plan garners significant news coverage its is by no means to impeach a president, in which they devise a second plan in order to seize power. The second plan is to trick the president into addressing the public that a world ending asteroid is about to hit earth. They succeed by switching a report from NASA regarding data from the Trailblazer 1 space probe -a fictional space probe- with Peter\\'s science project about the asteroid that hit earth causing the largest scale extinction on earth. This plan also succeeds and Mike address the public telling them he received a report from NASA that confirms a massive meteor is on an intersect course and will cause global devastation. The Bradys are then transported to a secret bunker underneath the White House that will protect them from the ensuing danger. The Speaker of the House then seizes the opportunity by to take power by calling an official press conference as acting president and saying, \"There is no danger, or emergency. The president is incompetent, and couldn\\'t tell the difference between a high school science project, and a sophisticated aeronautical diagram.\" Then asks the public to ask for an impeachment of the president. Meanwhile the Bradys find out from the Cindy -the youngest daughter- that she overheard the Speaker of the House and Veronica taking about their plan while underneath a table in the room Veronica pulled the Speaker of the House into. Mike realizes what happened and breaks out of the vault just as the Speaker of the House is encouraging the public to call for vote. Mike then asks Cindy to tell the press what she heard the Speaker of the House say, to which she somehow tells the story of her seeing the Speaker of the House switching the homework and the report. Mike then address the public saying they deserve to know the truth, and goes on to start telling the story of the lottery ticket and how he got to be president.'},\n",

Though Devan was a good raja, the actual powers of administration were in the hands of Kammaran and Perumana Kurup, who ran the state with heavy corruption and high-handedness which Devan was unaware of. After some years, Udayan and his fellow slave prisoners staged a coup in the ship, killing the captain and releasing themselves. Udayan ran away, became a rich Arab merchant after finding the lost treasures of Ali Raja and his daughter Lalia . Both decided to make a return to Kolathiri Kingdom in disguise to make their revenge. They return to the Kolathiri kingdom in a floating palace as an Arab Prince and Princess. Years made people to forget Udayan and no one was able to recognize him in his new attire and lifestyle, except for Queen Parvathi, who understood him in just a glimpse. King Devan and Queen Parvathi has one son, Prince Chandra ([[Shankar  who fell in love with Laila. Meanwhile Udayan was hatching a plot to trap Perumana Kurup, after coming to know that the crown and staff of Kolathiri Raja was in his custody . Udayan approached Perumana Kurup and let him know that he is interested in purchasing rare Jewels and crowns, at an astronomical price. Perumana Kurup brought the crown and staff out of hiding to sell it. However he was caught red-handed by the public and brought before trial. At the trial, he declared that the old raja gifted the crown and staff to him, for attempting to rescue the king from attack and he challenged the prosecutors that they have no evidence against him for betray and robbery. It was at this moment Lalia enters into court room, to declare her true identity as Princess Laila – the heir apparent of Ali Raja, who was the sole eye-witness to the incident. This made Perumana Kurup to commit suicide, when he tries to run away. Udayan's second target was Kammaran. Kammaran is the new finance minister of the state. The kingdom was facing extreme financial crisis due to mismanagement and corruption. Kammaran advises the king to seek financial assistance from the visiting Arab prince. Devan commissions Kammaran to hold talks with Arab Prince. Kammaran pays visit at the Udayan's palace, to seek finance, without understanding his true identity. Udayan refused to finance, rather says that he would finance if Kammaran becomes king. This offer made Kammaran greedy and he hatches a plan to trap Devan, similar to the way who he trapped Udayan earlier. In meantime Udayan double-crosses Kammaran, by sending a message to the Devan directly that he is ready to finance. This made Devan suspicious of Kammaran and secretly through his spies he understands the plot his close friend Kammaran made to trap him. Kammaran repeats the old strategy with assistance of the Kompan dacoits who asked the king to come directly with a tribute in order to prevent an attack. Devan along with a few soldiers handpicked by Kammaran, went to Kompan's camp with a treasure chest. However much to their surprise, instead of tribute, soldiers were hiding inside the chest, who attacked Kompan and killed Kammaran's soldiers. In meantime a large army of Devan stormed into the place, routing Kammaran's plans. Devan's army tried to capture Kammaran, but he was rescued by Udayan's soldiers. It was in Udayan's camp, Kammaran understood the true identity of Udayan and he was fired by Udayan's soldiers. Udayan's final revenge is now against Devan and he was planning on that. In meantime Prince Chandran through his close friend Kannan  who was Kammaran's son, came to know the double cross made by Udayan. He understood, it was Udayan who spoiled the relationships between Kammaran and Devan and challenged Udayan for a public duel, which Udayan accepts. That night a mysterious lady figure enters into Udayan's palace, which was Queen Parvathi, pleading for her son's life to Udayan. Udayan refuses, as he said that it was Prince Chandran to declared duel against him and he can't quit it. Queen Parvathi said that she understood it was Udayan in disguise and pleaded him considering her love earlier. Udayan promises that he won't kill Chandran. Prince Chandran saw his mother coming out of Udayan's Palace, which made him furious. He questioned his mother. It was then revealed by Paravathi to Chandran, that he is actually Udayan's son born to Parvathi. This made Chandran surrender to Udayan, while at the duel. Hearing his son's surrender without a fight made King Devan furious, who went to Udayan's palace to challenge him. It was there, for first time after his betrayal, Devan saw Udayan, which made him to fall down. When Udayan was about to kill Devan, Parvathi rushes and stops him, saying that Devan has paid for his sins, by raising up Chandra despite of knowing that he was the son of Udayan. This made Udayan to forget his revenge and he forgives Devan. He decides to leave. Hearing that the king has fallen, the Kompan dacoits raided the palace. As the king had fallen and attack was unexpected, the Kolathiri forces were overrun by the Kompan Army. However timely intervention of Udayan's army, killed Kompan and all his men. He took the crown and gave it to Devan and blessed all of them. When Devan asked Udayan to stay back, he said he has to go back, however gifted his stepdaughter Lalia to Chandran who was in love with her.\"},\n",

Fay takes her father's muscle car and his wedding ring, and departs from her home after saying her farewells to her sister. The story simultaneously follows the events of an overly medicated, nonsense-spewing young man in clown makeup, who appears to be dodging authorities whilst hopping from vehicle to vehicle along his travels. The clown stops at a gas station to steal a new ride; however, there is no vehicle to be found. The clown knocks out the cashier and steals the handy supply of drugs and junk food while a woman  stops for gas. The clown then ties the woman up while Fay stops for gas. As Fay searches the station for a clerk the clown rummages through her car, stealing her wallet, and then leaves in the cowgirl's truck, which later breaks down. After the clown takes a mysterious ride in the Devil Girl's flying vehicle, and Fay's car breaks down, both stop separately in an eerie, highly religious, nearby town. Fay takes a room in the local motel, using her father's ring as collateral, as her wallet was stolen earlier. The clown meets Fay and is speechlessly smitten by her. In an attempt to pay back her debts, Fay dances at the town's strip club. The local mechanic tells Fay that the part required to fix her car should be available after a week. One night the clown decides to enter the strip joint and witnesses hallucinations, including a dance by the Devil Girl, before seeing Fay dance and being thrown out of the club. After being driven back to the motel by an interested young man, Fay is raped in her room by a masked man and assumes it was the clown, due to the fact that she saw him outside of her window. The next night, the clown is back at the strip club, only to be kicked in the face by Fay and once again thrown out. Fay leaves in a rage to be picked up by the Devil Girl, and the two partake in sexual activities. The Devil Girl then confronts the local preacher and accuses him of being a pervert by nature, which is later revealed to be true when Fay attempts to retrieve her ring from the preacher, whom she was told by the motel owner was in possession of. Fay finds a young, naked man trapped in a cage below the church, and is then attacked from behind by the preacher, who is revealed to be her rapist, his identity betrayed by his mask. Fay stabs the preacher with a screwdriver and beats him with a two-by-four. She then frees the young man, and together they escape.

Three families represent three social classes: the Wilcoxes are wealthy capitalists, the class that is displacing the aristocracy; the Schlegel sisters represent the enlightened bourgeoisie; and the Basts are in the lower middle class.  The film asks the question \\'Who will inherit England?\\' and answers it through the ownership of the house, Howards End, as it passes from person to person. At the start of the film, the younger sister, Helen Schlegel , rashly becomes engaged to the younger Wilcox son, Paul. The next day both realise their mistake and break it off, but Helen has told her older sister, who tells her family. Her Aunt Juley  arrives at Howards End and so makes the Wilcox family aware of the engagement. Later, when the Wilcox family takes a house near to the Schlegels in London, the sister, Margaret Schlegel , feels compelled to visit because of the social embarrassment of the previous year. She befriends the mother, Ruth Wilcox . Ruth is descended from English yeoman stock and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes own Howards End, a house which she loves dearly and which is the symbol of rural England and English tradition. Over the course of a few months, the two women become close friends, and Ruth sees in Margaret a kindred spirit. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels\\' London house is due to expire, and knowing she is soon to die, Ruth bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation for the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her \"right mind\" or intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper that Ruth\\'s bequest is written on, and decide to keep her will secret. Because he knows that he has prevented the Schlegels from finding a home in Howards End, Henry Wilcox  offers to help Margaret find a new place to live. As a result, the two become close and Henry proposes. Margaret accepts. The Schlegels befriend a young, poor, yet intellectual clerk, Leonard Bast . Wishing to improve his lot, they pass along advice from Henry that Leonard should leave his post because his company is heading for a crash. Leonard does so, but finds himself in a worse position and eventually unemployed. The two plotlines converge at the marriage party of Evie Wilcox . Helen has found the Basts starving and brings them to the party. Jacky Bast  becomes drunk; Margaret approaches her with Henry to find out who she is. Jacky recognises Henry and it becomes clear that years previously he had had an affair with her. Humiliated and suspicious, Henry breaks off the engagement, but that evening he and Margaret reconcile and she forgives his sexual impropriety. In accordance with Henry\\'s wishes, she insists that Helen take the Basts away and refuses them help. Because of this, the Schlegel sisters drift apart. Helen has a brief affair with Leonard Bast. She becomes pregnant, and leaves the country, telling none of her condition. When Helen returns to take her possessions, she asks if she can stay one night at Howards End. When Henry Wilcox finds out that Helen is pregnant, he insists that she cannot stay in the house, and that the man responsible must be found out and punished for dishonouring her. Margaret and Henry argue bitterly about the different standards of sexual propriety applied to men and women, and Margaret says she is leaving Henry. Margaret, Leonard and the oldest Wilcox son Charles  all make their way separately to Howards End and the final tragedy unfolds: Charles attacks and inadvertently kills Leonard, and is arrested. Henry\\'s pride is shaken; his feelings break through at last, and he and Margaret become truly close. Ultimately, Ruth Wilcox\\'s wish is fulfilled: Henry leaves Howards End to Margaret upon his death. Helen is reconciled with Margaret, and Helen will raise her son as heir. In both film and novel, the final ownership of Howards End is a symbol of new class relations in England: the wealth of the new industrialists  married to the politically reforming vision of liberalism  that will benefit the children of the lower classes .'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The movie focuses on the media\\'s coverage of news, and whether covering the news changes it. The film has no opening credits . Instead, the program begins with a promo for a typical daytime network lineup: previews of a game show and soap opera are shown, along with a catchy jingle, \"RBS: We\\'re Moving Up!\" Suddenly, an ominous \"Special Bulletin\" slide appears on the screen, with an announcer saying \"We interrupt this program to bring you a Special Bulletin from RBS News.\" It shows how a local TV crew, covering a dockworkers\\' strike, become caught in the middle of a firefight between the U.S. Coast Guard and a tugboat sitting at a dock in Charleston, South Carolina. After several Coast Guard personnel are wounded, the Coast Guardsmen, apparently outgunned, surrender and are taken hostage, as are the reporter and cameraman. The reporter is asked to televise a statement by the terrorists of their demands: the delivery to them of every nuclear trigger device at the U.S. Naval Base in Charleston, so that they can be taken out to sea and destroyed. Without these special triggers, the nuclear weapons on the naval warships and nuclear-powered submarines based at Charleston, to include the Fleet Ballistic Missile  submarines, cannot be used. The terrorists reveal that they have constructed their own nuclear device—one roughly equivalent in strength to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. Their device is set to detonate within 24 hours if the demand is not met. It is also equipped with anti-tampering devices that will set it off if any attempt is made to move or disarm it. As the faux news broadcast continues, details about the terrorists slowly begin to emerge as the broadcast hosted by Susan Myles  and veteran newscaster John Woodley  continues. The group is led by Dr. Bruce Lyman , a scientist and former designer of nuclear weapons for the American government who had recently been imprisoned for taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations. His cohorts include David McKeeson  a nuclear scientist who stole weapons grade plutonium from the Hanford nuclear research facility in Richland, Washington and constructed the bomb; a bank robber whom Lyman met in jail; a poet and anti-war activist implicated in a bombing that killed several people a decade earlier; and a meek housewife and mother of two who had been friends with Lyman back in college. Several times during the program, Woodley finds himself debating with Lyman and his colleagues the ethics of television journalism and the role it plays in both covering the activities of terrorists and, at the same time, inadvertently promoting such activities. \"TV news is essentially show business,\" says McKeeson during a particularly heated exchange with Woodley. At first the government chooses to ignore and underplay the story. McKeeson eventually reveals his device, which is kept in the ship\\'s lower hold, to RBS\\'s cameraman. The scientist describes it as an Implosion-type nuclear weapon and ominously warns viewers that he designed the bomb to detonate should anyone try to tamper with it or move it. As facts come out indicating the threat being real, various public announcements occur, culminating with the decision to order the evacuation of the downtown Charleston area, which causes a public panic. The Government later announces, just shortly before the terrorist\\'s deadline, that it would accede to their demands. A van rolls up to the tugboat, allegedly containing the first load of triggers that they had demanded. In the interim, the terrorists, who are still holding the RBS reporter and cameraman, become suspicious when the TV on which they are monitoring the RBS broadcast suddenly goes blank, supposedly due to a transmitter power failure at the local station. In fact, the signal was cut-off to mask the arrival of a Delta Force team sneaking aboard the tugboat . In the ensuing gun battle, all but two of the terrorists are killed by the commandos. The journalists survive without major injury. McKeeson commits suicide before he can be captured. The remaining terrorist is taken into custody. All this occurs a little over an hour prior to the detonation time of the bomb. Members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team  enter the boat in an attempt to defuse the bomb. The reporter and cameraman remain to comment on their efforts, despite pleas from the news anchor in New York City that they leave the area. Over a remote camera installed on the tugboat, the NEST team is shown having an argument over how to bypass McKeeson\\'s many safeguards. Abruptly, the NEST team gets into a heated argument. At the studio, an expert, Dr. Nils Johannsen, brought in by RBS  says that there are conventional explosives in the device, geared to set up the chain reaction. \"They have just put a match under the whole pile!\" he says. The members of the NEST team are shown working frantically, then breaking into a panic just before the signal is abruptly broken. Static fills the screen and contact Charleston is lost. The network switches back to the main RBS newsroom in New York, which is initially in confusion, the broadcast image briefly going to a test pattern. Woodley at first shows annoyance, looking around at staffers and angrily barking out \"Somebody get me some information, dammit! What the hell is this?\" then falls silent and stunned as he realizes what has probably happened. Myles, nervous and cautious, merely advises viewers that they \"seem to have lost contact\" with Charleston. After considerable effort to reestablish contact, the anchors manage to get hold of Megan \"Meg\" Barclay , a reporter for the local RBS television affiliate station in Charleston, WPIV, who was two miles from the tugboat aboard the aircraft carrier museum ship USS Yorktown across Charleston Harbor on the opposite bank of the Cooper River in Mount Pleasant. In the midst of wreckage aboard the aircraft carrier, with huge fires blazing in downtown Charleston in the background and clearly stunned and dazed, she expresses fear of imminent radiation sickness. Her cameraman, who has also survived, reveals that he was recording a few moments earlier and they ask him to rewind and play back the recording. The tape shows Barclay standing in front of a relatively normal looking harbor overlooking the tugboat, facing the camera, her back to the boat. We then see an enormous bright light coming from the other side of the harbor. As the camera lens recovers from the sudden flash of light, we catch a brief glimpse of a mushroom cloud rising over the shoreline, followed by a huge blast of wind that blows through and knocks the camera over. The tape ends. The cameraman then pans the harbor which is now nothing but a firestorm. At this, Myles breaks down, saying \"Oh, my God!\" on the air. More chaos is revealed in Charleston itself: scenes of fires , destruction and wounded people. It is revealed that the government\\'s intention was to play for time until the Delta Force team could be put on the ship, on the assumption the nuclear response team could defuse the nuclear weapon. Now, local authorities and the government have to deal with the destruction of a city, and after showing scenes of mass destruction farther out from the blast, a tearful John Woodley can only say \"This is a very dark moment\" as the image fades to black. The film then moves ahead three days to reveal the aftermath of the explosion. Thanks to the evacuation, the immediate death toll was less than 2,000; however, another 25,000 suffer severe injuries, including about 4,800 severe burn cases, at a time when the total number of burn unit beds in the United States numbers only about 2,400. Some half a million are left homeless due to inland fallout and the region is expected to be uninhabitable for decades. At this point, the broadcast shifts its attentions from the destruction of Charleston to cover other chaotic subjects around the world such as  which have continued to occur despite the destruction of Charleston.'},\n",

At a Paris theatre, Mario saves Countess Isabelle Gravini  from being annoyed by a marquis. When Mario is stabbed in the back by the marquis after a duel, Lucien also feels the pain. Finally, when the twins are twenty-one years old, Paoli reunites them. They both swear to avenge their parents by killing Colonna, now the tyrannical ruler of Corsica. In addition, Lucien confirms that what he experienced actually occurred to Mario. They begin slaying Colonna's relatives, one by one, pretending to be the same person, leaving Colonna wondering how the bandit chief could be in two widely separated places in such a short time. Meanwhile, Colonna decides to marry Isabelle. When her father ([[Pedro de Cordoba  refuses to consider the union, he is poisoned. Mario tells Isabelle of Colonna's intentions and hand in her father's death; she flees with Mario to the bandit camp. There they fall in love. A confused Lucien consults Dr. Paoli, unsure whether his own love for Isabelle is real or just a reflection of his brother's feelings. When Paoli is unable to answer, Lucien decides he must kill Mario in order to be truly free to live his own life. After Lucien confesses his love to Isabelle and embraces her against her will, Mario finds out and confronts him. Lucien tries to kill his hated brother; Lorenzo breaks up the knife fight. Unaware of this development, Isabelle decides to return to Paris to avoid creating a rift between the brothers. On the way, however, she is spotted and taken to Colonna. Colonna's trusted adviser, Tomasso ([[John Emery , finally figures out that the Franchi twins are behind everything. They set a trap, using Isabelle as the bait. When Lucien refuses to risk his men, Mario pretends to be a French jeweler to try to rescue Isabelle. Maria , Colonna's mistress, helps him, but he is recognized and captured. He is whipped to try to extract Lucien's hiding place. Colonna forces Paoli to attend. When Mario faints, Paoli administers a drug that makes it appear as if Mario has died. Later, he manages to revive the young man. Lucien, no longer sensing his bond to Mario, believes his brother is dead. He takes his band to deal with Colonna. He catches Colonna unarmed, but is fatally shot in the back by Tomasso. He manages to kill Tomasso before collapsing. Then Mario appears. In a sword fight, the last Franchi slays the last Colonna. Before Lucien dies, he reconciles with his brother.\"},\n",

To pay for a flight home for Christmas, Charlie accepts a temporary job over Thanksgiving weekend looking after retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade , who Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous blind alcoholic. Charlie and George Willis, Jr. , another student at the preparatory school, witness several students setting up a prank for the school\\'s headmaster Trask . Following the prank, Trask presses Charlie and George to divulge the names of the perpetrators. When Charlie refuses to talk, Trask offers a bribe, a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to Harvard. Charlie continues to remain silent but appears conflicted. Shortly after Charlie arrives, Slade unexpectedly whisks Charlie off on a trip to New York City. Slade reserves a room at the Waldorf-Astoria. During dinner at an upscale restaurant, Slade glibly states the goals of the trip, which involve enjoying luxurious accommodations in New York before committing suicide. Charlie is taken aback and does not know if Slade is serious. They pay an uninvited surprise visit to Slade\\'s brother\\'s home for Thanksgiving dinner. Slade is an unpleasant surprise for the family, as he deliberately provokes everyone and the night ends in acrimony. During this time the reason behind Slade\\'s blindness is also revealed. As they return to New York, Charlie tells Slade about his complications at school. Slade advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that Willis will probably be pressured into not maintaining silence. Later at a restaurant, Charlie and Slade observe Donna , a beautiful young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Slade leads Donna in a spectacular tango  on the dance floor. That night, he hires an escort. Deeply despondent the next morning, Slade responds to Charlie\\'s suggestion that they test drive a Ferrari. Charlie lets Slade drive the car and Slade begins speeding, attracting the attention of a police officer , who Slade manages to appease without giving away his blindness. When they return to the hotel, Slade sends Charlie out on a list of errands. Charlie initially leaves the room but quickly becomes suspicious. Charlie returns to find Slade in his military uniform, preparing to commit suicide with a gun from which Charlie had made Slade promise to remove the bullets earlier, to which Slade states \"I lied\". Charlie intervenes and attempts to grab Slade\\'s gun. Slade, however, easily overpowers him, threatening to shoot Charlie before himself. They enter a tense argument, with both struggling for the gun, however, after Charlie bravely calms Slade, he backs down. The two return to New England. At school, Charlie and Willis are subjected to a formal inquiry in front of the student body and the student/faculty disciplinary committee. As headmaster Trask is opening the proceedings, Slade unexpectedly returns to the school, joining Charlie on the auditorium stage for support. For his defense, Willis has enlisted the help of his wealthy father, and divulges the names of the perpetrators, qualifying that his vision wasn\\'t clear. When pressed for more details, Willis passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie\\'s expulsion. At this, Slade cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and questioning the integrity of a system that rewards informing on classmates. He tells them that Charlie has shown integrity in his actions and for the committee to not expel him because this is what great leaders are made of and he will make them proud in the future. The disciplinary committee decides to place on probation the students named by Willis, and to give Willis neither recognition nor commendation for his testimony. They excuse Charlie from any punishment and allow him to have no further say in the inquiries, to loud applause from the student body.

              "  'plot': ' The American oyster King dictates to a room full of typing writing women. He smokes a large cigar held by one of his many butlers at his side. One butler scurrys in to say, “Your daughter is in a fit of raging madness” Ossi, in the other room, has destroyed the room by throwing everything onto the floor. Mister Quaker oddly jogs through the house to see Ossi on the other side of the mansion. When Mister Quaker peeps in, Ossi throws newspapers at him. He asks, “Why are you throwing those newspapers?” and the brat replies with, “Because all of the vases are broken.” Ossi is clearly angered, and in a big mess. She shows her father a newspaper that says the Shoe cream king’s daughter has married to a count. This is what Ossi is upset about. Mister Quaker is not impressed but tells Ossi that he will buy her a prince. With this, Ossi can’t contain herself, jumps up, and hugs her dad ever so enthusiastically. She is so happy, she could smash the house with joy! We then meet Seligson, the matchmaker, who is dealing with a woman with a turned up nose. She complains about the price and how all of the bachelors have imperfections. She then leaves unsatisfied. As she exits, Ossi enters the room smiling and hands the matchmaker a note from Mister Quaker. It says, that because of the shoe cream king’s daughter is married, and because oysters are more important, then his daughter should be married too. She needs a man with a family tree that is in accordance with the Oyster king’s. The matchmaker searches his wall full of bachelors and comes across Prince Nucki. Nucki lives high up in a building on the 47th floor, he has heavy debts, and is not inclined to marriage. With the great match, the matchmaker leaves instantly. Meanwhile, Ossi is instructed in the ways or marriage which happen to be all about babies. Her instructor is a strict looking woman in black with thin glasses and hair ever so tightly pulled back. Ossi bathes the doll and shakes it off to dry it. She is yelled at for not holding it correctly, and Ossi snaps back at the teacher and continues to shake off the doll. Then, she is instructed to powder the baby, but unknowingly powders its face. Ossi is so confused about why she should powder its bottom that she exclaims, “that’s funny.” She goes to touch the bottom but disgusted, tosses the naked doll behind her, across the room, and proceeds to throw powder puff at the instructor. We enter the small flat of Prince Nucki where he and his friend Josef, both in nice dress suits, are hand washing clothes and hanging the wet clothes around the flat to dry on lines. The matchmaker comes to meet Nucki. When he rings the bell, Nucki and Josef look at each other in a fright and begin to take off all of their rings, and other nice materials, thinking it might be their poorer friends, but when Josef sees that it is Seligson, they hurry to put on all of the rings and jewelry they just took off. Josef greets the matchmaker and tells him that he will see if the ‘highness’ will see him. “In the meantime, take a seat on the banister,” Josef says. When he goes back in, the two of them scamper around to fix up the place to make it look decent, and start throwing things off screen. When Seligson enters, Nucki is upon a throne of an old chair and a wooden box. Seligson tells Nucki that he’s got a nice match. He tells Nucki that the light-haired Ossi has hair as black as night, to which Nucki shakes his head but who cares when the girl has that much money. Nucki decides that he needs to send his adjutant to look at her. Josef and Nucki can\\'t believe that the matchmaker actually believed them. They fix Josef up in a suit and top hat. Back at the Quakers, Ossi grows impatient after a grueling hour and a half of waiting. She is all flustered so she snags Mister Quakers paper out of his hands, but he must be used to this because he simply pulls another out of his pocket. Ossi declares that if she doesn’t have a husband in five minutes, she’ll demolish the house. To this, Mister Quaker welcomes her to it and hands her a vase to smash. To his invitation she breaks a mirror with the vase, but Mister Quaker calmly replies, “ I’m not Impressed.”  Josef shows up at the Quakers. Upon arrival, all of the waiters, butlers and other workers of the house standing at attention, bow to Josef and then take away his hat and cane in a hurry. One asks for his card, and after a few moments of fumbling around his borrowed coat, he gives Nucki’s card to the butler. This is where all of the confusion starts. When she gets the card, Ossi becomes so excited to know the prince is there. Josef waits in the unusually large drawing room where you can\\'t even see the ceiling. Quaker is taken to his room to sleep while Ossi is readied. This is a long process. Ossi does nothing to get herself ready, because she just has all of her maids do it for her. She is carried from room to room on a conveyor belt of women. Josef begins pacing around the room, faster and faster. Josef is startled at how quickly ten servants show up after pushing a single button. Josef is impatient, and Quaker is not impressed at all. By the time Ossi is finally ready, both Quaker and Josef are asleep. She walks in, looking quite similar to before, takes one look at Josef, and says, “Good Lord, he looks stupid!” But this doesn’t stop the marriage-thirsty Ossi, and she rushes them off to be wed in a hurry. She doesn’t even bother to wake her father, or introduce him to her soon to be husband. The two ride off in a carriage drawn by 10 horses. Ossi wants a quick marriage so they visit a priest at his house and have the ceremony through his window, where Josef doesn’t even say a word for Ossi declares that he has nothing to say anyways. After the quick I do, they pay the priest, and rush off, back to the Quaker house. When Ossi introduces her new husband to the servants, they boil over with laughter. Josef then is sent to introduce himself to Quaker, but when he asks how to get there, all he gets is a ridiculously large sized map and a friendly, “Bon Voyage!” Josef is mistaken for a butler and is ordered to blow Quakers nose. When Quaker finds out that he isn’t a butler but really his son-in-law, he states, “I’m not impressed.”  On account of the hurry, the wedding celebration includes only the closest family members. Dozens upon dozens of waiters, butlers, and chefs rush around to prepare a feast for the 50 closest family members. There are lines and lines of waiters waiting to serve the guests. Josef is in heaven and is scarfing food and chugging his drinks. Mister Quaker makes a toast, “Excuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law,” to show his feelings about the new member of the family. Ossi punches Josef and tells him so ironically to not be so greedy. Josef’s toast is short, saying that he hasn’t had that much to eat in a while. \"A Foxtrot Epidemic Suddenly Breaks Out During The Wedding\" There is a gigantic band and a wide dance floor in one room where the Foxtrotters enter and dance around. The band has an animated bandmaster who likes to move around, and shake his stuff. As everyone dances, Ossi dances alone. Quaker tells her to not dance so unrestrained, but she thinks that’s rubbish and continues to dance. At this point, every person in the house is dancing, even the workers. The kitchen has become another dance floor. Ossi dances with a waiter, and Quaker dances with a guest. The band plays on with its unique instruments such as the man slapping another man on the beat. Josef in the other room, continues to gorge himself with food and drinks. While Josef is enjoying himself thoroughly, Nucki is at home eating his usual, pickled herring. His friends barge in and ask him to come along on a spree. At the end of the party, Quaker is tired and sweating like a pig, and Josef is happily still up drinking, sitting in a room filled with his empty bottles. He can barely walk, but somehow makes to the bedroom where Ossi goes in her room and sends him to the other. He tries to grope her and go to her room, but a butler sends him back over to his room. Right after, Quaker goes to the door to sneak a peek on the two, but only finds the lone Ossi already sleeping with her teddy bear, at which he seems not impressed.  Nucki returns from the spree. The men are all drunk and stumble over to some benches to rest. Nucki deliriously stumbles over to speak to a horse on a carriage. That morning, Ossi attends the official breakfast for young women given by the Multi-Millionaires’ Daughters Association Against Dipsomania. They toast, “Down with dipsomania!” They then have their consulting hours, only because their patients will sober up by themselves if they don’t cure them first. All of their patients are these drunken old men. Nucki is driven over by the carriage, and is takes in to be helped. When the daughters see Nucki, the only handsome and young man, they go wild, and fight over him, which he doesn’t mind at all. They decide to have a boxing match to decide who will cure the man. The women file into a room already dressed in boxing attire, and fight to the last one. Ossi is the last one standing, and immediately falls for Nucki, the raving drunkard. She sneaks in a kiss, and then takes him to a ‘private treatment’ which just so happens to be in her bedroom. When Ossi leaves, Josef gets up and goes over to peek into Ossi’s room, only to find s man lying in her bed, so he runs to tell Quaker. Ossi returns to Nucki, her patient, and they flirt, and find that they are fond of each other. They kiss, but are upset because they want to be together but she has already been married, and he thinks he has to soon, so they burst out into tears. Josef bursts into the room and realizes that it’s Nucki and starts laughing uncontrollably. He asks them, “Do you know that you two are married to each other?“ and then explains to them that he has gotten married under Nucki’s name. Nucki and Ossi are so happy at this they kiss some more. The real wedding. This time around, it is just the Quaker, and the Bride and groom at a small table. Nucki and Ossi can hardly contain themselves, and escape off to her bedroom without Quaker even noticing. Once he notices that he is the only one left at the table, he goes to find them. He peeks into their room only to find them cuddling in bed. Quaker is so happy that the only thing he can say is, “Now I&#39;m impressed!”'},\n",

Peter is rooting around his house, in an attempt to rid himself of Lisa\\'s stuff, to help deal with the grief. Abigail takes one of her mother\\'s shoes and pulls a piece of paper out of it, saying it was for Peter to find. On the paper is written \"Lake Como\". Soon after this, Peter finds a strange message on her cell phone from a man, wishing only to hear Lisa\\'s voice. It creates a tension in the mind of Peter and he decides to check her e-mails and finds several similar requests in there too. He also finds a secret folder named “Love” on her Desktop which is password protected. It creates a strong suspicion in his mind that she had a secret love affair and that her lover is mailing her now. He tries to open the folder by breaking the password for several days, but in vain. He replies to the mails of “Ralph” pretending to be Lisa. He requests one of his trusted co-workers to find out the real name & exact location of the sender of these e-mails by tracing down his IP Address, through his email address, which is an offence. His co-worker tells him that Rafe’s real name is Ralph , who lives in Milan. Peter continues to try to access the \"love\" folder on Lisa\\'s computer, and becomes increasingly frustrated. In anger he types \"Lake Como\" and when he applies that as the password, the folder opens. It contains thousands of her photos & videos with Ralph in their passionate moments & near “Lake Como” where she first met Ralph. In order to find out more about his wife\\'s lover, he secretly locates and follows Ralph in Milan. He then goes to a Milanese Cafe, one of Ralph\\'s haunts, and begins to play chess alone. Ralph engages him in conversation, and they begin to play chess and talk. Ralph easily speaks about Lisa & their relationship, unaware that Peter is Lisa\\'s husband. Ralph tells him that it is he who has suggested she start a Shoe designing business after perceiving her unique understanding of shoes and her passion towards different new designs, which this industry lacks. Over a period of time, they play several games of chess and, as far as Ralph is concerned, have a friendship. Abigail learns of her mother\\'s affair, while listening to her mother\\'s voicemail, and deduces her father\\'s frightening obsession with vengeance. She goes to Milan and tries to convince her father to stop hunting for Lisa’s lover as she had already gone, as well as to accept her husband George . She also warns him that his craziness will lead him to lose everything . Peter becomes greatly upset and he goes uninvited, with murderous intent, to Ralph\\'s apartment. There, to his surprise, he learns that Ralph is not the cosmopolitan man of the world as he has been portraying himself, but an impoverished janitor. Peter\\'s hate diminishes, but not his urge to avenge. He sends an e-mail, as Lisa, to Ralph, asking that he meet her at Lake Como. Ralph tells Peter about his upcoming meeting, and Peter gives him money to enable the meeting. Ralph also plans to throw a party for Lisa in London, as he sees this latest meeting as a sign that their relationship is taking off. Ralph goes to Lake Como, but instead of finding Lisa there, Ralph finds Peter waiting for him, and Peter reveals to Ralph that he was Lisa\\'s husband, and that Lisa is actually dead. Ralph tells Peter that Lisa had known about his humble origins and poor socio-economic background. She also helped him financially on several occasions. He also forces Peter to confront that it is his excessive devotion for his work & cold nature towards marital life, which had moved Lisa to seek warmth in Ralph\\'s arms, but still loving Peter so much that she never was ready to leave him, in spite of cheating with Ralph. Throughout this conversation, it is shown through flashbacks that Lisa died of cancer, and that she did not tell Peter about it until \\'it was too late\\'. It is then revealed that, when Lisa was about to die due to critical illness, she wrote something on a piece of paper and asked her daughter to put it in her red shoes so that one day Peter would find it. But Lisa instructs Abigail not to tell him about the letter. Abigail asks how he would find the message when he doesn\\'t even know about its existence, but she replies that he will definitely look for it and find it on his own one day. This is the piece of paper with \"Lake Como\" on it from earlier. When Ralph asks her to tell Peter about their affair, end their marriage and move in with him, Lisa refused, saying that she did not want to hurt Peter and make him endure the pain of separation. She promised to reveal her dark secret to Peter at the appropriate time in her life so that he can forgive her for her infidelity. Peter and Ralph part, with Peter seemingly more bitter and angry than ever. Ralph has arranged a dinner in Lisa\\'s memory, and at first, Peter refuses to go. However, he realizes that “forgiveness and love need to replace hate”, and arranges to be at the dinner with Abigail and her husband. Traveling home after the dinner, we see Peter reconciled with George, Abigail\\'s husband.'},\n",

The figure gives the woman a white rose, which then turns red and dappled with blood, and tells her that \"the day of their Deliverance is at hand.\" Prince Prospero, a Satanist, visits the village over which he holds dominion, and is confronted by two angry villagers, poor and starving. They inform him of the doom-laden message, which they believe is a prophecy of Prospero\\'s downfall and liberation of the village. Prospero angrily sentences the pair to death, but a young Christian peasant girl named Francesca begs for their lives. Prospero demands that Francesca choose which of the men is to be saved and which is to die  but she is spared from having to choose when Prospero discovers that the old woman who encountered the red figure is infected with a deadly plague, the Red Death. He orders the village burned down to prevent the spread of the disease, and abducts Francesca. Prospero then invites several dozen of the local nobility to his castle for protection against the Red Death. At the castle, Francesca is finely dressed and tutored in etiquette by Prospero\\'s jealous consort, Juliana, and the gathered nobility are entertained by a pair of dwarf dancers, Esmeralda and Hop-Toad. When Esmeralda accidentally spills a goblet of wine, one of Prospero\\'s guests, Alfredo, strikes her. Prospero frightens Francesca with his coldness and attempts to corrupt her, in order to destroy her faith in God. He shows her a succession of different coloured rooms, but warns her not to enter the Black Room while she is still \\'uninvited\\'. Juliana expresses her wish to Prospero to be initiated in to his Satanic cult, and, that night, Francesca is terrified to discover Juliana and Prospero lying in a strange, hypnotic state in the Black Room. Gino, meanwhile, is being held prisoner in Prospero\\'s castle, with the castle guards teaching him armed combat so that he can fight to the death against Ludovico as entertainment for the nobility. While Prospero further attempts to seduce Francesca, Juliana performs a ritual in the Black Room, pledging her soul to Satan. Francesca is horrified to learn of her actions, but Juliana gives Francesca the key to Ludovico and Gino\\'s cell, and tells her to leave. During their escape, Gino and Ludovico kill three guards, and are then recaptured by Prospero, who points out to Francesca how her father and Gino have sinned. At a grand feast, Prospero summons Gino and Ludovico. As they refuse to fight each other, he instead has them each choose daggers to cut themselves with. One of the daggers is coated with poison, and, upon choosing the last dagger  Ludovico attempts to stab Prospero with it, but Prospero stabs him through the heart with his sword. He then casts Gino out of the castle, leaving him to be killed by the Red Death. Gino runs away through the woods, and encounters the red-cloaked figure, who presents him with a Tarot card, which he says represents mankind. Juliana is then put through her final initiation ceremony, where she drinks from a chalice, and suffers a terrifying hallucination  involving wild, dancing figures that stab at her as she lies prostrate on a table. Awakening from her dream, Juliana then declares herself the wife of Satan, proud that she has \\'survived her own sacrifice\\'. She wanders out through the coloured rooms, and is viciously attacked and killed by a crow. Prospero comments that Juliana is now truly married to Satan. Meanwhile, Hop-Toad, enraged by Alfredo\\'s previous ill-treatment of Esmeralda, plans his revenge by persuading Alfredo to wear an ape costume to Prospero\\'s grand masked ball, where Prospero has instructed that no one is to wear red. In the guise of the ape\\'s trainer, Hop-Toad cruelly humiliates Alfredo in front of the assembled guests, before soaking him with brandy and setting him on fire. Prospero rewards Hop-Toad for his amusing \\'entertainment\\'. Outside the castle walls, Gino returns to rescue Francesca, and once again encounters the red-cloaked figure. The figure tells him not to enter the castle, and promises that he will send Francesca out to Gino shortly. Amid the general atmosphere of debauchery and depravity at the ball, Prospero notices the entry of the mysterious, red-cloaked figure. He and Francesca follow the figure through in to the Black Room, where Prospero believes the figure to be an ambassador of Satan. He asks to see the figure\\'s face, but the figure tells Prospero that \"There is no face of Death until the moment of your own death.\" As the ball is transformed into a danse macabre, Prospero asks for Francesca to be given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure appears to consent to his request, and sends Francesca outside, where he knows Gino is waiting. Before leaving, Francesca sadly kisses Prospero. The red-cloaked figure then reveals that he is not a servant of Satan  and tells Prospero that his beliefs will not save him, declaring that \"Each man creates his own God for himself - His own Heaven, his own Hell.\" Prospero rips off the figure\\'s red mask to reveal Prospero\\'s own blood-spattered face. The figure is the Red Death himself - Prospero\\'s \\'own Hell\\', and the \\'moment of his death\\'. Prospero attempts to flee through the now infected crowd, but his red-cloaked self is always in front of him. The Red Death finally corners Prospero in the Black Room, asking, \"Why should you be afraid to die? Your soul has been dead for a long time\", and strikes him down. In an epilogue, the Red Death is seen playing with his Tarot cards with a young child. Other similarly cloaked figures then gather around him, each wearing a different colour: the \"White Death\", the \"Yellow Death\", the Golden Death, the Blue Death, the Violet Death and the \"Black Death\". They discuss among themselves the numbers of people each of them had \\'claimed\\' that night, each accepting of their endless terrible task. When asked of his work, the Red Death says to them, \"I called many...Peasant and prince...The worthy and the dishonoured. Six only are left.\" Among the surviving six are Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl that the Red Death plays cards with, and an old man from a nearby village. The Red Death declares \"Sic transit gloria mundi\"  and the cloaked figures file offscreen in a grim procession. Over the procession are Poe\\'s words: \"And darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all\".'},\n",

The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women – Nova , Reena , and Meagan  – who get away in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails. In space, an alert goes out for the safe return of the women with a reward of 3,000 \"mega-credits\". A small time salvage operator named Wolff  intercepts the message and heads to the planet. Joining him is his female engineer Chalmers , who learns the planet – called Terra XI – is a failed colony that fell victim to a deadly plague and civil warfare. Wolff risks the dangers believing the reward will solve his debt problems. After landing on the barren world, Wolff and Chalmers set out in a 4-wheel drive vehicle called the \"Scrambler\". Soon, they join a battle in progress between a group of marauders  and a band of nomads . The Zoners take the women before Wolff can stop them and fly away on jet-powered hang-gliders. Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into \"The Zone\" which is ruled by \"Overdog\" – their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds Chalmers –\\xa0who is really an android –\\xa0has been \"killed\". Wolff continues on alone, but soon catches a teenage Scav named Niki  trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead. In the meantime, the three women are taken before \"The Chemist\" , the chief henchman of Overdog who administers pacifying drugs to the girls and prepares them for Overdog\\'s pleasure. Elsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his – a soldier named Washington , who reveals he too has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off world. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself. Back in The Zone, the women are taken to see the Overdog , who is revealed to be a hideous cyborg, almost entirely machine, with two metal claws for hands. Still led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments – from being attacked by mutated blob-like beings, to strange mermaid-like women and their giant water dragon. He even loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. Washington assists, but only if Wolff cuts him in 50/50 on the reward. Wolff and Washington team up and sneak into Overdog\\'s fortress where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki  decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end where Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy in turn recharges Overdog. Wolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog\\'s claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the complex explodes, the three heroes, and the three rescued women, manage to get away. In the end, Wolff invites Niki to stay with him and she agrees since they made good partners.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The Piano tells the story of a mute Scotswoman, Ada McGrath , whose father sells her into marriage to a New Zealand frontiersman, Alistair Stewart . She is shipped off along with her young daughter Flora McGrath . The voice that the audience hears is not her speaking voice, but her mind\\'s voice. Ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old, expressing herself instead through her piano playing and through sign language for which her daughter has served as the interpreter. Ada cares little for the mundane world, occupying herself for hours every day with the piano. It is never made explicitly clear why she ceased to speak. Flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher whom Ada believed she could control with her mind, making him love her, but who \"became frightened and stopped listening,\" and thus left her. Ada, Flora, and their belongings, including the piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by the ship\\'s crew against her angry objections. As there is no one there to meet them, they spend the night alone, sheltering under a tiny tent made of a hoop skirt frame. The following day, Alistair arrives with a Māori crew and his friend Baines , a fellow forester and a retired sailor, who has adopted many of the Māori customs, including tattooing his face and socializing with the Māori instead of his own race . There are insufficient men to carry everything and Alistair abandons the piano, again eliciting objections from Ada. Alistair proves to be a shy and diffident man, who is jokingly called \"old dry balls\" by his Māori cohorts. He tells Ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano. Ada, in turn, makes no effort to befriend him and continues to try to be reunited with her piano. Unable to communicate with Alistair, she goes, with Flora, to Baines and asks to be taken to the piano. He agrees, and the three spend the day as she plays tunes on the beach. While he socially aligns himself with the Māori, Baines has steadfastly refused any sexual activity with Māori women. But he clearly finds Ada attractive due to her passion for music. Baines eventually retrieves the instrument and suggests that Alistair trade it{{mdash}}and lessons from Ada{{mdash}}for some land that Alistair wants. Alistair consents, oblivious to the budding attraction between Ada and Baines. She is surprised to find that he has had the piano put into perfect tune after its rough journey. He asks to simply listen rather than learn to play himself, and then offers to let her buy the piano back, one key at a time, by letting him do \"things he likes\" while she plays. Ada reluctantly agrees, as she is attracted to Baines. Ada and Alistair have had no sexual, or even mildly affectionate, interaction even though they are betrothed to marry. Baines is sexually aroused by Ada\\'s playing to the point that he openly approaches her. Finally, she yields to her own desire one afternoon, and she and Baines have intercourse. Alistair finally begins to suspect the love affair and after discovering them, he angrily boards up his home with Ada inside when he goes off to work on his timberland. After that interlude, Ada avoids Baines and feigns affection with Alistair, though her caresses only serve to frustrate him more because when he makes a move to touch her in return, she pulls away. Before Alistair departs on his next journey, he asks Ada if she will go to see Baines{{mdash}}she shakes her head no{{mdash}}and he tells her he trusts that she won\\'t go to him while he\\'s gone. Soon after, Ada sends her daughter with a package for Baines, containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration that says \"dear George, you will have my heart, Ada McGrath\". Flora has begun to accept Alistair as her \"papa\" and is angered by her mother\\'s infidelity. She brings the piano key instead to Alistair. After reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, Alistair furiously returns home and cuts off Ada\\'s index finger with an axe to deprive her of the ability to play her piano. He then sends Flora to Baines with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, with the message that if Baines ever attempts to see Ada again, he will chop off more fingers. After Ada recovers from her injury, Alistair sends her and Flora away with Baines and dissolves their marriage. They depart from the same beach on which she first landed in New Zealand. While being rowed to the ship with her baggage and the piano tied onto a Maori longboat, Ada feels that the piano is ruined as she can no longer play and insists that Baines throw the piano overboard. As it sinks, she deliberately puts her foot into the loop of rope trailing overboard. She is rapidly pulled deep underwater connected by the rope to the piano{{mdash}}but then she changes her mind and kicks free to be pulled back into the boat. In an epilogue, she describes her new life with Baines and Flora in Nelson, where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home, and her severed finger has been replaced with a silver finger made by Baines. Ada says that she imagines her piano in its grave in the sea, and herself suspended above it, which \"lulls me to sleep.\" Ada has also started to take speech lessons in order to learn how to speak again. The film closes with the Thomas Hood quote, from his poem \"Silence,\" which also opened the film: \"There is a silence where hath been no sound.

Likewise Hafiz, enthralling with his vocalist talent while playing the guitar, dividing his time between school and mother, who is hospitalised for brain tumor. It all started after Mahesh, amongst the students assigned to get the finalists to school for practice, delivered the notice of successful audition to Melur\\'s house. His handsome looks attracted the girl. Early on of their relationship, tragedy struck Mahesh\\'s family when his uncle Ganesh who had been the care-taker of the family since the loss of Mahesh\\'s father, was stabbed to death on his wedding day. Melur thinking that Mahesh\\'s silence was due to his grief over the tragedy became furious when she was continuously ignored. She regretted it however after Hafiz revealed Mahesh\\'s situation. That changed Melur\\'s perception of Mahesh. Likewise Mahesh, who grew comfortable with the presence of the girl who often quotes beautiful poetry. Mahesh, realizing that the relationship will be opposed, kept it hidden from his mother, still grieving over the death of Ganesh. Alas, the secret was exposed and Mahesh was assaulted before Melur\\'s very eyes. Just a day before the competition, is Melur resilient enough to sing the poetic lyrics of her song when her heart is tormented by the thoughts of Mahesh? What about Mahesh who has found his first love? On Talentime night, everything unfolds.\\n12848514\\tNancy Weston , a reporter for The Globe, approaches Abraham Gentry , an obnoxious private investigator, and offers him $25,000 on behalf of The Globe to investigate the brutal murder of stripper Suzie Cream Puff . She sweetens the deal with a $25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene , whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout , an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like Lewd is Crude\", \"Quit with Tit\" and \"Women Right On!\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \"Women Right On!\" is found at the scene. Meanwhile, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Weston\\'s drunken episodes she admits she\\'s attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie . Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a $1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry\\'s trap.'},\n",

Inside the laboratory, Gary Fallander  and Russ Snow  have made a completely new species of locust that is genetically engineered to eat insects that destroy crops. In the main room in the crop dome, Russ releases the locusts into a crop field filled with insects for one minute, luring them back into the main holding pen using a strong pheromone lure. One of the main vents jams midway through the process and Gary sends one of the Silogen workers into the tunnel system. The worker finds that the vent is stuck in the open position and after scanning the holding pen, the locusts attack the worker and he is killed within a few seconds. The locusts then escape from the Silogen Research Facility through the open vent. Meanwhile, on a small farm near Prairie, Colt Anderson  is producing a new kind of organic pesticide which he introduces to his friends, Bill and his wife Agatha. Colt leaves the farm to check his pesticide and Bill starts his husker blade to harvest the corn. The blade suddenly jams, Bill gets out to investigate and discovers the remains of a bull that has been almost completely eaten. He radios Agatha and tells her about the bull. Agatha hears something in the corn and discovers the remains of her son, Mike. Grief-stricken, she starts to panic. Bill heads towards his combine and discovers that it is covered in locusts which attack and kill him. Agatha runs through the field and is also attacked and killed by the locusts. Colt arrives on the scene and finds the dead body of a locust. He runs to the medical hospital where his girlfriend, Vicky , works as a veterinarian. Vicky and Colt then hear reports of cows and farm animals dying in the same way as the bull on Bill's farm. Vicky and Colt examine the remains of a dead cow and find a locust in it. Meanwhile in Prairie, a family having a picnic is attacked by the locusts and their son is the only survivor. A police officer takes him to a hospital. Colt examines a dead locust that was on the car that the police officer used to bring in the child and discovers that it is a juvenile. Vicky tries to tell him that the locusts were all drones but the examination proves that the locusts are breeding. Colt, Vicky, Greg  and a group of men find the locusts' nest and the men spray pesticides to kill the larvae and locusts. This irritates the locusts and they attack the group. Colt, Vicky and Greg are the only survivors. This leads Colt to wonder why they were not attacked. Back at the headquarters of the USDA, Greg decides that the only option they have is to spray the locusts with UD-66, the most dangerous chemical weapon on the planet. Vicky tells Greg to issue the order despite Colt telling her that if they spray it, plants will not grow back for 10 years. Meanwhile, the swarm of locusts attacks an amusement park off the major highway. Hundreds of people at the amusement park are eaten alive by the locusts. Back at the laboratory, Colt  examines the locust larva to try to figure out why they didn't attack Vicky; he then tries on some live adult locusts and discovers that chemical pesticides attract them. Greg then gathers a large amount of livestock in a field and the locusts arrive. He orders a helicopter to drop the pesticide which had been changed to UD-45. Despite Colt trying to get to the field to tell Greg and Vicky what he has discovered, the helicopter drops the pesticide and the pilots are attacked by the swarm, destroying the helicopter. Colt then decides to use the organic pesticide he developed on the locust swarm which has now attacked the town of Prairie and during the attack Gary who was trying to flee is killed by the locusts. Colt flies a plane over the city and drops the pesticide and the swarm of locusts dies instantly. But before they can celebrate, two larger swarms appear over the city and this time, Vicky's father, Russ, decides to lure the locusts into the crop dome using the pheromone lure. The pheromone works and the locusts fly into the crop dome. Russ then sacrifices his life by going into the dome and programming it to self-destruct. The crop dome explodes, killing all of the locusts, but there it is one more truck with possibly with hundreds of hungry locusts in the rear compartment headed towards another crop dome.

The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust , a World War II \"Pre-Atomic\" Submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen , and Batman and Robin must stop them.

When The Dynamic Duo return to the buoy via The Batboat with the projector on it, they are trapped on it by a magnet and torpedoes are launched at them, but they escape using a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise is hit by the last one. Catwoman, disguised as the Soviet journalist \"Miss KITKA\" , lures Bruce Wayne into a trap as part of a plot to destroy Batman, little suspecting that Wayne is Batman\\'s alter-ego.

Robin poses the question whether it might not be in the world\\'s best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so—in reminder of the fate of Penguin\\'s five henchmen\\'s tainted rehydration—and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own. However, in the final scene, Robin\\'s wishes are ironically fulfilled when the Security Council is improperly re-hydrated. All of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings.

A Scarabax beetle watches as the Mask of Life creates a body for Mata Nui, who almost steps on the Scarabax. He picks up the Scarabax, who touches his mask. Upon doing so, the beetle changes into a living weapon. Just then, a being called a Vorox attacks Mata Nui and after a struggle, flees without its stinger, which has fallen off. Mata Nui picks up the stinger as a vehicle carrying a villager named Metus  speeds towards him. The fast-talking Agori recruiter takes Mata Nui to Vulcanus as he tells the once ruler about life on Bara Magna. Local villages scavenge for what remains, building shelters, survival gear and ultimately arenas where they can settle their disputes. Putting the best Glatorian from each village against one another, tribes can quickly end quarrels based on the outcome of the fight. Metus introduces Mata Nui to Raanu , the Agori leader of Vulcanus, who is too interested in the fight between veteran fighter Strakk  and Vulcanus\\' prime Glatorian, Ackar , to talk. Strakk eventually falls in battle, but gets up and fells Ackar after conceding, a move that gets him banned from the fights. Mata Nui intervenes and gets beaten down by the angry Strakk. As Mata Nui tries to use the stinger to defend himself, the mask transforms it into a sword. Mata Nui quickly defeated Strakk, gaining Ackar as a friend in the process. Metus later attempts to recruit Mata Nui, who refuses. Ackar introduces the hero to Kiina , a feisty Glatorian from the village of Tajun. In exchange for showing the two Glatorians a secret cavern underneath Tajun, Kiina would like to leave Bara Magna with Mata Nui, believing that anywhere is better than her native planet. On their way to Tajun, the three Glatorians are ambushed by a Skopio beast, along with a group of Bone Hunters, who were told the Glatorians location by an Agori traitor. After trapping both beneath a rockslide, they discover that Tajun had been raided by the combined efforts of the formidable Skrall army and the Bone Hunters, despite the fact that the two forces were rival tribes. A Glatorian rookie, Gresh , had been trying to defend the village and was badly injured. The heroes follow Kiina to the caverns, where they encounter Berix , a thief. While Berix tends to Gresh, the other three discover a hidden chamber containing a picture of the robot that was once Mata Nui\\'s body. As the Glatorians leave, Gresh complains about his weapon being damaged, then Ackar wonders if what Mata Nui did with Click  and the Vorox tail would work with the Glatorian weapons . Mata Nui successfully repairs and transforms the weapons. In addition, these weapons grant the Glatorian elemental abilities of fire, water, and air for Ackar, Kiina, and Gresh, respectively. The three practice their newfound powers as they travel to Gresh\\'s village, Tesara, while Ackar teaches Mata Nui to stay alert in battle and to study and find his opponent\\'s weakness. To the protests of Raanu and Metus, the four Glatorian stop a fight between Vastus  and Tarix , telling the crowd of Agori that they must unite their villages against the threat of the Skrall—Bone Hunter alliance. Mata Nui proves his worth to the crowd by transforming Tarix\\'s and Vastus\\' weapons. In the hot springs not far from Tesara, Kiina follows a mysterious figure. It turns out to be Berix. Kiina is now convinced that Berix is the traitor. But then, the actual traitor corrects Kiina. The two are then captured by the Bone Hunters and the true traitor. Back in Tesara, Raanu and Metus alert the Glatorian about Kiina and Berix\\'s kidnapping. Mata Nui ignores Ackar\\'s and Gresh\\'s offers for assistance and sets off for the Skrall camp on his own. Kiina and Berix are held in a suspended cage near the mouth of a cave at the Skrall camp, both arguing about the former\\'s caverns. Mata Nui confronts Tuma, the Skrall leader and challenges him to a one-on-one fight, and eventually defeats him. As he claims Tuma\\'s shield in victory and frees Kiina and Berix, the traitor, now revealed to be Metus, appears. He explains how he got the nomads and the Skrall to unite under him. Now in control of the army, he orders the Skrall and Bone Hunters to kill off the three. Just then, the Skrall and Bone Hunters are attacked by an immense being in the shape of Malum, composed of Scarabax beetles. Mata Nui gives Berix Tuma\\'s shield, and after lots of chaos, defeats a pack of bone hunters. Mata Nui sees Metus fleeing in his vehicle and follows him. A couple of unchained and vengeful Vorox overturn Metus\\' chariot, sending him tumbling to the feet of Mata Nui. Mata Nui picks him up and, despite Metus\\' attempt to bargain with him , presses the traitor to his mask, transforming Metus into a snake as a representation of what he truly is. As he slithered away, he claims that his united army cannot be defeated. Realizing this to be the key to winning, Mata Nui has the Glatorians combine their powers against the waves of Skrall and Bone Hunters. As the defeated army flees, the Glatorian rejoice, except for Kiina, who believes Berix to be killed in battle. She quickly finds him alive under a pile of rocks holding a Skrall shield. As the Glatorian and Berix watch the combined efforts of the Agori and the Scarabax beetles pulling the villages together, they notice that the combined villages formed a large robotic body, similar to the one Mata Nui\\'s spirit once inhabited. To further this, Berix pulls out a coin with the Unity-Duty-Destiny symbol, the Bara Magna symbol, and the Mask of Life symbol on one side, and the Skrall symbol on the other. Berix shows them the Skrall shield and acknowledges that they are both similar to each other and that the mazelike symbol forms a map. With this information in hand, Ackar, Kiina, Gresh, and Berix prepare to set off for their next adventure with a legend... reborn.'},\n",

He had been trained to an incredible level of skill in taking on the five hairpin corners plus using the gutter techniques of Mt. Akina . The film chronicles his evolution from an uninterested delivery boy into a hardened tōge racer, also showing how he learns techniques of racing without affecting his delivery load. Takumi drives his father, Bunta Fujiwara's Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX  which is seemingly unmodified but is perfectly suited for the downhill corners of Mt. Akina, which gains the attention of local street racers all across the prefecture. Some ultimately challenge Takumi to races on Akina's downhill, including Takeshi Nakazato who leads the NightKids team and drives a Nissan Skyline GT-R . Ryosuke Takahashi, leader of the RedSuns team and a driver of the Mazda RX-7  helps out Takumi along the way by giving him advice and teaching him about car mechanics. Takumi agrees to race Ryosuke in three weeks. While following the path of a street racer, Takumi must deal with his alcoholic father and his girlfriend Natsuki Mogi  who's with an older man  at a love hotel for two weeks as he takes on more difficult challenges. With all the talk on Takumi's AE86, Takumi's close friend Itsuki Tachibana buys a new car after his Nissan Silvia gets totalled. He wounds up buying but swindled  getting a faulty AE86 instead. Takumi was lured by Itsuki to teach driving down Mt Akina, but halfway through, a member from the Emperor Team taunts them and almost made them crash, which makes Takumi angry and successfully getting back at the Emperor Team's racer, where his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV crashed. Takumi thus gains more fame, but the Emperor Team is mad. Afterward, his AE86 apparently breaks down mechanically after being bothered from a racer in the Emperor Team as payback, which led to Bunta dropping a new TRD 20-valve SilverTop racing engine and modifying the car. Takumi tests his new car, but is not used to the new mechanics, until Bunta teaches him how to drive right, he becomes ready. Though, Takumi is bothered by Natsuki's absence, and despite a fight between Itsuki and him where Itsuki claimed he saw Natsuki coming out of a love hotel with her older partner and he impulsively declares Natsuki a slut , Takumi suspects something amiss about her. When Ryousuke and Takeshi arrive to pick him up for their duel, Takumi follows, but he briefly sees Natsuki with her older partner, which seemingly confirms what Itsuki saw. At last the showdown on the Emperor Team, Ryosuke and Takumi race along with the racer from the Emperor Team, Kyouichi. Ryousuke and Takumi handle their common opponent from the Emperor Team and work together. The Emperor Team loses when Kyouichi swerves to avoid hitting another car and refused to listen to advice. The race then leaves only Takumi and Ryosuke where they take each other on. In the midst, Bunta explains the factors on Takumi's chances to win, and finally Takumi succeeds to win the event by beating Ryousuke at the last hairpin turn with the new car's mechanics that he learned. After the race, at a convenience store Ryosuke offers Takumi a chance on a racing team composed of expert racers, on which Takumi has been undecided. Until he discovers his girlfriend being dropped off by the older partner he confirms the suspicions of her and he runs away from her, but she kept running towards him. Outrunning Natsuki and back to his car where he tearfully drives away, he is upset and their relationship ends with Natsuki regretfully crying. In the end Takumi apologizes to Itsuki and he joins Ryousuke's team as the film ends.\"},\n",

As the freelancing protector of the black community, Undercover Brother  fights this organization\\'s efforts to subdue the spread of black culture. In addition to the endeavors of Undercover Brother, an organization known as the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. battles The Man to ensure the continuance of black culture.

As they approach the airport the plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. They find their Swedish business partner, Skyler, has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie, an attractive American and her Australian friend Anne. Outside, they witness what appears to be an Aurora Borealis. But some of the light begins to fall from the sky, landing everywhere. The lights then disappear, and when a police officer walks up to investigate he suddenly disintegrates along with many others who were near the lights. The lights are aliens protected by almost invisible force field. They start hunting and killing everyone, sending everyone into a panic. Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for several days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. On the way, they find a police car which Ben and Sean search for supplies while the others hide in a nearby mall. While searching the car, they see a barking dog that gets disintegrated. Ben and Sean hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing its lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the guys run to the mall. Sean realizes that lights gives the aliens away. The group takes shelters in one of the stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and they almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorizes that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not even through glass. The group finds the American Embassy has been gutted. All except Skyler goes to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian. They hear gunfire and see an alien approaching Skyler. The boys try to save him, but are too late. When the others go outside they see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and Sergei, an electrical engineer. He made his apartment into a giant Faraday cage that hides everyone from the aliens. He also developed a microwave gun that weakens the aliens' force field so they can actually kill it. Vika and Sergei translate the message; which announces a nuclear submarine is waiting in the Moscow River to take survivors to safety. As Sergei shows the boys the microwave device, Vika, Natalie and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase, but Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien kills Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape, but Anne hesitates again and is killed. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika. They meet up with Russian police who managed to wound an alien with conventional weapons, and Sean collects a piece of it. The police were also able to build another Faraday cage at the local library. The team eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow. While moving through the subway an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen. Ben helps her climb down to the tracks, but disintegrated as Sean watches his best friend die. The survivors make it to a boat on the river, planning to travel downstream to the waiting submarine. The boat soon gets stuck and a new light beam destroys a building right next to the river, causing them to capsize and be thrown into the water. Swimming for the submarine, Sean discovers Natalie is missing. They see a flare fired from Natalie's flare gun and Sean is determined to get her, possibly missing his chance to escape. The police agrees to help him rescue her after the Russian submarine crew builds another microwave gun with stronger batteries. Sean finds her hiding on a bus as the police and Vika destroy three more aliens using the microwave guns. As Sean is about to get off the bus with Natalie, an alien climbs on board, locks the door and sends the bus speeding around the city. It almost kills Natalie after pulling her towards it. Sean kills the alien after destroying its shield. He discovers their weakness - throwing a piece of a wounded alien he had collected earlier at the unshielded alien kills it instantly. The two manage to stop the bus back where the others are, narrowly avoiding a collision. After returning to the submarine, the team decides to stay and fight for their city, telling the kids the war has begun.

His subsequent obsession with Margaret\\'s deception drives him half-mad and puts a severe strain on his relationship with his current lover, Beth Ryan , a fellow professor. Owen Lift  is a timid, middle-aged man who still lives with his overbearing, abusive mother . Owen fantasizes of killing his mother but can\\'t summon the courage to bring his desires into fruition. As a student in Larry\\'s community college writing class, Owen is given advice by Larry to view an Alfred Hitchcock film to gain some insight into plot development. He happens to see Strangers on a Train, in which two strangers conspire to commit a murder for each other, figuring their lack of connection to the victim will, in theory, establish a perfect alibi. Having overheard Larry\\'s public rant that he wish his ex-wife dead, Owen forms a plan to kill Margaret, believing that Larry will, in return, kill his mother. He tracks Margaret down to Hawaii and follows her onto a cruise ship, apparently pushing her overboard while she tries to retrieve an earring that fell out. Owen returns from Hawaii to tell Larry of Margaret\\'s death and that Larry now \"owes\" him the murder of his mother, lest he inform the police that Larry was the killer. After having spent the night drinking alone during the hours of Margaret\\'s disappearance, Larry panics because he lacks a sufficient alibi. That, along with a news report announcing that the police suspect foul play, convinces Larry that he\\'s the prime suspect. He decides to stay with Owen and his mother in an attempt to hide from the police. Larry meets Mrs. Lift, but despite her harsh treatment of him he refuses to kill her. Eventually, when Mrs. Lift drives Owen to breaking point, Larry finally relents and agrees to go through with the murder. The first attempt involves Larry smothering Mrs. Lift with a pillow while Owen is out bowling, but Larry backs down when he sees her eyes open, and narrowly avoids being seen by the police when they come by to question Owen about Larry\\'s whereabouts. The second attempt involves Larry pushing Mrs. Lift down the basement staircase through the door which Owen earlier loosens, but it fails when Mrs. Lift bangs the door and it stays still. Larry tries the trap, but it is sprung and he is apparently killed, to Mrs. Lift\\'s amusement. In retribution, Owen tries killing Mrs. Lift himself by blowing a trumpet in her ear to give her a heart attack. The noise wakes Larry up and they both inspect Mrs. Lift, but she suddenly wakes up and knocks Larry out in her delusion. Eventually, Larry flees the Lift home when Mrs. Lift recognizes him as a suspect from a news broadcast about his ex-wife\\'s disappearance. He boards a train to Mexico and, surprisingly, Owen and Mrs. Lift come along so as to avoid having to lie for him. During the journey, Larry\\'s patience with Mrs. Lift reaches its pinnacle when she impolitely gives him advice on writing. He follows her to the caboose with the intent of throwing her from the train, but Owen begins having second thoughts about having his mother killed and gives chase. In the ensuing fight, Mrs. Lift falls from the train but is rescued by Owen and a repentant Larry. Mrs. Lift is grateful at her son for saving her, but unappreciative of Larry\\'s help and kicks him, resulting in him losing his balance, landing on the tracks, and breaking his leg. During his recovery in the hospital, Larry discovers that Margaret is still alive; she simply fell overboard by accident and was rescued by a Polynesian fisherman whom she has decided to marry. Much to his annoyance, Larry learns that Margaret plans to sell the rights of her ordeal for $1.5 million dollars. On the advice of a fellow patient, Larry chooses to free himself of his obsession with his ex-wife and instead focus on his own life, thereby freeing him of his writer\\'s block, making him a happier man and mending his relationship with Beth. A year later, Larry has finished a novel based on his experiences with Owen and Mrs. Lift entitled Throw Momma from the Train. Owen visits and informs him that his mother has died  and that he\\'s going to New York City for the release of his own book. Unfortunately for Larry, Owen reveals that his book is also about their experiences together. Thinking that his book has been scooped once again, an enraged Larry proceeds to strangle him, but stops when Owen shows him the that book is a children\\'s pop-up book called, Momma, Owen, and Owen\\'s Friend Larry with the story drastically altered to be suitable for children. Months later, Larry, Owen, and Beth holiday together in Hawaii, reflecting on the final chapter of Larry\\'s book. Larry\\'s and Owen\\'s books have now become best-sellers, making them both successful writers as well as close friends.'},\n",

During the celebration, he is approached by an elderly woman who places a pocket watch in his hand and pleads \"come back to me\". Richard does not recognize the woman, who returns to her own residence and dies soon afterward. Eight years later, Richard is a successful playwright living in Chicago, but has recently broken up with his girlfriend and is struggling with writer\\'s block. Feeling stressed from writing his play, he decides to take a break and travels out of town to the Grand Hotel. While looking at a display in the hotel\\'s museum, Richard becomes enthralled by a photograph of a beautiful woman. With the assistance of Arthur Biehl , an old bellhop who has been at the hotel since 1910, Richard discovers that the woman is Elise McKenna , a famous early 20th century stage actress. Upon digging deeper, Richard learns that she was the aged woman who gave him the pocket watch eight years earlier. Traveling to McKenna\\'s home, he discovers a music box she had made, in the shape of the Grand Hotel, that plays his favorite melody. He also discovers among her effects a book on time travel written by his old college professor, Dr. Gerard Finney , and learns that McKenna read the book several times. Richard becomes obsessed with the idea of traveling back to 1912 and meeting Elise McKenna, with whom he has fallen in love. Visiting Finney, Richard learns that the man believes that he himself very briefly time traveled once to 1571 through the power of self-suggestion. To accomplish this feat of self-hypnosis, Finney tells Richard, one must remove from sight all things that are related to the current time and trick the mind into believing that one is in the past. He also warns that such a process would leave one very weak, perhaps dangerously so. Richard buys an early 20th century suit and some vintage money and cuts his hair in a time-appropriate style. Dressing himself in the suit, he removes all modern objects from his hotel room and attempts to will himself into the year 1912 using tape-recorded suggestions, only to fail for lack of real conviction. Later, while searching the hotel\\'s attic, Richard finds an old guest book from 1912 with his signature in it and realizes that he will eventually succeed. Richard again hypnotizes himself, this time with the tape recorder hidden under the bed, and allows his absolute faith in his eventual success to become the trigger for the journey back through time. He drifts off to sleep and awakens to the sound of whinnying horses on June 27, 1912. Richard looks all over the hotel for Elise, even meeting Arthur as a little boy, but he has no luck finding her. Finally, he stumbles upon Elise walking by a tree near the lake. She seems to swoon slightly at the sight of him, but then suddenly asks him if he is \"the one\". McKenna\\'s manager, William Fawcett Robinson , abruptly intervenes and sends Richard away. Richard stubbornly continues to pursue Elise until she finally agrees to accompany him on a stroll through the surrounding idyllic landscape. Richard ultimately asks why Elise wondered aloud if he was \"the one\". She replies that Robinson somehow knows that she will meet a man one day who will change her life forever. Richard then shows Elise the same pocket watch which she will eventually give him in 1972, but he does not reveal its origin, merely saying it was a gift. Richard accepts Elise\\'s invitation to her play, where she recites an impromptu monologue dedicated to him. During intermission, he finds her posing formally for a photograph. Upon spotting Richard, Elise breaks into a radiant smile, the camera capturing the image which Richard first saw of her 68 years later. Afterwards, Richard receives an urgent message from Robinson requesting a meeting. Robinson tries to get Richard to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. When Richard professes his love for her, Robinson has him tied up and locked in the stables. Later, Robinson tells Elise that Richard has left her and is not the one, but she disbelieves him, stating that she loves Richard. Richard wakes up the next morning and escapes his constraints. He runs to Elise\\'s room and finds that her party has left. Despondent, he goes out to the hotel\\'s porch. Suddenly, he hears Elise calling his name and sees her running towards him. They return to his room together and make love. The next morning they agree to marry. Elise tells him that the first thing she will do for him is buy him a new suit, since the one he has been wearing is about fifteen years out of date. Richard begins to show her how practical the suit is because of its many pockets. He is alarmed when he reaches into one and finds a Lincoln penny with a mint date of 1979. Seeing an item from his real present wrenches him out of his hypnotically-induced time trip, and Richard feels himself rushing backwards with Elise screaming his name in horror as he is pulled inexorably out of 1912. Richard then wakes up back in the present. He is drenched in sweat and very weak, apparently exhausted from his trip through time and back. He scrambles desperately back to his own room and tries to hypnotize himself again, without success. Heartbroken and after wandering around the hotel property and sitting interminably at the places where he spent time with Elise, he eventually retires to his room and remains there unmoving for days until discovered by Arthur and the hotel manager; they send for a doctor and paramedics. Richard suddenly smiles and sees himself drifting above his body and, having presumably died of a broken heart, is drawn to a light shining through the nearby window, where he is reunited with Elise.'},\n",

They decide to provide Santa with some proof that children still believe and that they still deserve toys from Santa, so the elves visit the United States in search of Christmas spirit. They face setbacks both in South Town, which is celebrating its annual Winter Festival, and in their dealings with the jealous, competitive Miser Brothers, who refuse to compromise long enough to permit a Christmas snow in the southern town. Finally, Santa\\'s faith in children is renewed with the help of the boy Iggy Thistlewhite.  The most obvious differences are in the setting, which is moved to the 21st century present day, and the music, which is all but gone. Only the iconic \"Miser\" songs are retained . The remake also includes two subplots which do not appear in the original: The commercial coup of Santa\\'s toy-making operation by the ambitious elf Sparky, who wants a more modern and lucrative approach; and the family troubles of Iggy. His father  is too busy to focus on his family, even at Christmas. Mayor Thistlewhite is a foil both for Santa, in his journey to rediscover the Christmas spirit, and for Sparky, in his efforts to sell out the town\\'s historic district to an out-of-town commercial enterprise. In addition, the movie attempts to give more depth to the relationship between Mrs. Claus and Santa. Another difference is that it is Santa who sees the Miser Brothers about having it snow in South Town instead of Mrs. Claus. Like in the original, the brothers refuse to cooperate, but change their minds when Santa threatens to go to their mother. A number of pop-culture references pepper the script, including a glimpse of the original Year without a Santa Claus special on Jingle\\'s portable TV.The Year Without a Santa Claus   - Trivia Faced with the prospect of losing his job because of Santa\\'s retirement, Jingle muses that he could go to work for his cousin, who is a dentist; this refers to Hermey in Rankin-Bass\\' Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

Jack buys a gas station, Shirley becomes a housewife, and they have a son. For fun, Jack races his sportscar against others on deserted stretches of road late at night. One time, Shirley talks him into letting her drive. She wins and continues winning. A chance encounter with professional driver \"Big Daddy\" Don Garlits  gives her the idea to look for sponsorship from one of the major car manufacturers, despite her husband\\'s skepticism. This being the 1950s, a pretty housewife is not taken seriously, especially since there are no women pro drivers at all. But when she returns home, Jack tells her that he can build her a dragster. In 1966, she is ready. She still needs to get three signatures before she can get her National Hot Rod Association  license, nearly impossible in the macho racing world. Finally, Garlits  signs, followed by funny car driver Connie Kalitta , who has his own reasons; Connie talks a reluctant third driver into going along. In her first attempt to qualify for a race, she sets a track record. Later, during a dinner with their respective spouses, Connie gets her alone, makes a pass at her, and gets slapped in the face. Shirley becomes successful, racing on weekends, but when Connie decides to move up to Top Fuel dragsters, she wants to buy his funny car and compete year round.

              "  'plot': 'In 1959, Louis Simo , a Los Angeles private investigator more interested in generating an income than in devotion to his clients, is helping out a client named Chester Sinclair by spying on Chester\\'s wife, under the impression that she is cheating on him, by taking pictures outside of a building she goes to from time to time. On a visit to see his son and ex-wife Laurie, Simo learns that his son is upset over the death of George Reeves, the actor who played Superman on television. Reeves was recently found dead inside his Beverly Hills home with a gunshot wound to the head, which lead the police to rule his death as suicide. Simo learns from a former colleague on the police force that the Reeves suicide has aspects that the cops don\\'t want to touch. Simo, sensing the potential for making a name for himself, begins investigating the case and notes several apparent conflicts with the official version of Reeves\\'s death. Simultaneously Simo bickers with Laurie over his failures as a father, particularly now when his son seems so troubled. In 1951, Reeves, a charming man whose acting career has stalled, catches the eye of a beautiful woman and they end the night in each other\\'s arms. In the morning, a newspaper photo reveals to Reeves that the woman is Toni Mannix, the wife of Eddie Mannix, the general manager of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Frightened that an affair with a studio boss\\'s wife will destroy what\\'s left of his career, Reeves is angry that Toni didn\\'t tell him. Toni, however, tells Reeves that she and Eddie have an open relationship and not to worry. The pair fall in love and the much wealthier Toni begins to buy Reeves expensive gifts such as a house, a car and jewelry. During their relationship Reeves gets the starring role in the television show Adventures of Superman. The role makes Reeves famous and gives him a steady income, but he longs for a more \"serious\" role and is uncomfortable with the public identification of him as Superman. As the years pass and Toni ages, Reeves becomes bitter at being a kept man and at Toni for not using her clout to help his career. He meets a young woman in New York, Leonore Lemmon, and leaves Toni for her. Toni is broken-hearted and furious, and Eddie seethes at her \"mistreatment\" by Reeves. Meanwhile, Simo initially suspects that Leonore Lemmon might have accidentally shot Reeves during an argument and imagines how the scenario might have played out. Later, Simo arrives back home to find thugs, who apparently were working for Eddie Mannix, in his house who beat Simo in hopes of scaring him off the case. This and other evidence lead Simo to suspect that Eddie had Reeves murdered and, again, Simo imagines what such an event might have looked like. Simo then learns that his client Chester Sinclair has murdered his wife because he got tired of waiting for information from Simo. A stricken and guilt-plagued Simo gets drunk and visits his son at school, but his inebriation scares the boy. Later, Simo visits Reeves\\' manager, Arthur Weissman. Weissman speaks highly of Reeves and his charm. He gives Simo a home movie Reeves had shot in hopes of promoting wrestling work. What Simo sees in the film suggests to him a sadness in Reeves, a weariness and humiliation with where his life has led. Simo\\'s final imagined variation on Reeves\\' death concludes with the actor shooting himself. This is the most vivid of the three scenarios, with Simo imagining himself standing in the corner of the upstairs bedroom, and even making eye contact briefly with the weary Reeves. Each of the scenes imagined by Simo begins with Reeves playing guitar and singing \"Aquellos Ojos Verdes\" in Spanish for his house guests. Reeves himself was fluent in Spanish. The Spanish lyrics of the popular song lament a love that can never be fulfilled. After each of the three imagined renditions, Reeves says goodnight to his guests, then retires to his bedroom upstairs, just before the gunshot. Reeves\\' quest for fame and success and Simo\\'s realization of how that quest is paralleled in his own existence causes the detective to re-evaluate his life. Simo watches another home movie, this one of himself and Laurie and their son in happier days. The film ends with Simo coming to Laurie\\'s house wearing a suit and tie, and greeting his son hopefully.'},\n",

              "  'plot': 'The film theorizes a conspiracy upheld by big government through money control by citing books as Tragedy and Hope by Carroll Quigley, Philip Dru: Administrator by Edward M. House, The Strawberry Statement by James Simon Kunen and The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The film is summarized in seven conclusions: # There is a conspiracy among some of the richest people in the non-communist nations and that its power is protected by their respective governments. That it is perpetuating its wealth by creating money out of nothing. # In the USA it is perpetuated through the Federal Reserve system. That although it appears that the executive branch controls them it is in fact the other way around. # The capitalist conspiracy in the USA surfaces in the Council on Foreign Relations that influence on the public through television, education and press. # The capitalist conspiracy opposes communism only on the surface because it needs the illusion of a foe. And because the chaos byproduct of the managed conflict advances its own goal of totalitarian world government. A tactic called \"pressure from above and below\" laid down in Edward M. House\\'s novel Philip Dru: Administrator deliberately create problems and frightful domestic and foreign conditions and provide solutions that result in publicly accepted government expansion at the expense of personal liberties and national sovereignty. # There is \"much evidence indicating\" that both the capitalist and communist conspiracy is directed by a single master conspiracy that may have continuity with The Illuminati, but that this historical question is not as important as what can be done about it. # The reaction to the conspiracies should be to dismantle the big government and localizing schools and police. # That the root of the evil is that money is created out of nothing. The solution is to reduce the power of the Federal Reserve and returning to the gold and silver standards and thus preventing anyone, in or out of government, to manipulate the money supply. Exposing the conspiracy to public view, by circumventing the establishment\\'s channels of mass communication, would cause it to collapse.'},\n",

Ben and Virgil are the quintessential Asian Americans, seen as highly intelligent overachievers whose only goal is to gain acceptance into the highly prestigious Ivy League universities. In fact, Ben learns a new SAT vocabulary word every night through rote memorization and recitation. These words act as the dividers between different chapters of Ben's life. In reality, Ben reveals that he in fact uses his perfectionism in order to act out in other ways, such as toilet papering houses with Virgil and other petty crimes. Part of these activities include the purchase and return of computer equipment with Virgil, and Virgil's cousin Han Seoul-Oh  to earn easy money. Ben is involved in many of the school clubs, all of which are being used to pad his college application. He makes the basketball team, though he soon discovers that he is merely a bench player. At the same time, Ben develops a crush on his new lab partner, Stephanie Vandergosh , a girl of Asian descent who was adopted by a white family. After meeting Daric Loo , the senior valedictorian and the president of nearly every student club, Ben becomes part of schoolwide cheat-sheet operation. Ben pays Jesus, another student, to break into the faculty office and steal the tests, then proceeds to sell off the cheat sheets to students. Ben also brings in Virgil and Han into the operaton, and the four of them make a small fortune. Meanwhile, Ben has fallen in love with Stephanie. He discovers that her boyfriend, Steve Choe , who is rich and arrogant, does not seem to appreciate her. Steve discovers Ben's crush and offers to let him take her to the Winter Formal. Ben soon discovers his life becoming more and more out of control. As a member of the Academic Decathlon team with Daric, Virgil and Han, the practices at Daric's house devolve into drinking parties. Later, the group, now intoxicated, arrive at a party, where they are accosted by a football player who mocks them for their perfect image. A fight results in Daric pulling out a gun, stopping the fight. At school the next day, news of the fight spreads around school and the four’s notoriety increases. Theories run rampant, including a possible link to the Chinese mafia. They gradually expand into more and more dangerous scams, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and eventually, drugs. They become users themselves, and Ben begins to develop a heavy cocaine habit. They also throw wild parties at Daric's house, which results in their lives running wildly out of control. Ben accompanies Steve to a batting cage after selling him drugs. Steve expresses to Ben that he knows he should be happy with what he has, but he is not since he feels stifled by the expectations that others have of him. On his birthday, Ben wakes up with a nosebleed as a result of his cocaine use. This is enough to scare him into changing his life. He meets the remainder of the group and tells them that he wants to quit. Daric agrees with him, expressing that their operation has become a full-time job. Daric presents a gun from the three of them to Ben, wishing him a happy birthday. Virgil continues the operation on his own, but, without the influence of Daric or Ben, is soon discovered thanks to his own carelessness and bragging. Han is forced to take the blame for the cheat sheet operation and is suspended, but not before he proceeds to beat up Virgil. Ben begins to rebuild his life, studying hard again and engaging in volunteer activities once more. He also begins to spend more time with Stephanie, who reveals a wild side of her own when she gives him a CD [Music You Hump To] that she shoplifted. Ben gathers up the courage to ask Stephanie to the formal, to which she agrees. The four leave to Las Vegas for the Academic Decathlon championships. Daric hires a prostitute and the group proceeds to have sex with her, with Ben being the first. During his turn, Virgil pulls a gun on the prostitute and she storms off. Han berates him, but Virgil pulls the gun on him, resulting in Han angrily storming off. Despite the turmoil, the team wins the competition. Ben and Stephanie attend the winter formal together and continue to get to know each other. During the formal, the two share a dance. The situation is made clear to Ben when Steve is seen outside of the formal, waiting to take Stephanie home. Steve meets Ben at the basketball court and tells him that he has information on a possible score. Though Ben is reluctant to re-enter his previous activities, he gathers up the group once more and meets Steve at his home. The group is stunned when they are informed that Steve wants them to rob his parents' house. He refers to it as a wake-up call. Ben and Han are against the plan, but Daric convinces them to participate, saying that this would be the perfect opportunity to give Steve his wake-up call. They agree Steve’s plan and practice constantly. They also agree to purchase Steve a gun. On New Year's Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus' house. With Ben acting as lookout, Han, Daric and Virgil begin attacking Steve. The lights go out as Virgil’s gun slips away from him. Steve lunges for the weapon and the struggle for the automatic results in it going off. Ben hears the shot and rushes into the garage. Ben beats Steve nearly to death, stopping only when Han yells to him. The four are stunned at what they just did and get Jesus to agree to allow them to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch. Daric soaks a rag in gasoline and, with a tearful Virgil holding him, suffocates Steve with it. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year's party, where they each split up. Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight, to which Stephanie tells an apologetic Ben that it is okay. The cell phone ring tone came from Steve's phone, which shows that the missed call was from Stephanie. Ben debates about whether or not to report Steve's murder to the police. The knowledge of his role in the murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts to commit suicide after calling over Han under the premise of watching some pornography. He survived the gunshot wound, but will most likely suffer brain damage. Daric arrives shortly after Ben, makes a flippant remark that angers Han and Ben escorts him out of the room. Daric expresses concern about the possibility of Han or Virgil revealing their secret. Ben simply resolves to do nothing and leaves Daric alone. With the group now permanently separated, Ben is alone at school. He goes to the basketball court but is unable to attempt a shot. On his way home, Stephanie pulls over in her new car and picks him up. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying she and Ben will continue their relationship. As they drive off, Ben's voice over tells the audience that he has no idea what is going to happen or what the other guys will do but all he knows is that there is no turning back.\"},\n",

Electrical wires are placed around his ears, and the Iraqi intelligence officer, Captain Saïd , explains that he learned interrogation techniques from the Americans and berates him about the hypocrisy of American involvement in the region. Troy is subjected to several electric shocks, and is finally forced to drink motor oil by Saïd, who lost his family during the American bombing of Baghdad. The Americans with the rebels go to a band of Iraqi Army deserters, who are persuaded to sell them luxury cars stolen from Kuwait. The cars are outfitted as Saddam\\'s entourage, in a ruse to scare away the bunker\\'s defenders, pretending that an enraged Saddam is coming to kill them for losing the gold. After storming the bunker they free Troy, who spares the life of his torturer, as well as more Shi\\'ite dissidents held in a dungeon. But a few of the soldiers who ran away return, and Conrad and Troy are shot. Conrad dies but Troy survives with a punctured lung, requiring a flutter valve in his chest to relieve pressure so he can breathe until they reach a hospital. Archie radios Walter, arranging transport and telling him to bring Adriana, while the hapless officers in camp try to locate the trio after getting the message from Troy\\'s wife. Each of the rebels is given a bar of gold and the rest is buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans will escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing. But the American officers arrive in helicopters and stop the group, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie, Troy and Chief nod to each other, and Archie proffers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. All of the soldiers are cleared of the charges thanks to Adriana Cruz\\'s reporting. Archie and Chief go to work as military advisers to action films, and Troy returns to his wife and baby, running his own carpet store. The stolen gold was returned to Kuwait, although they claimed that some was missing.'},\n",

He nonchalantly removes and steals a ring from the decaying finger of the skeleton in the tomb. He reaches inside once more, but an unknown force slams the coffin\\'s cover closed, cutting off one of his hands in the process. In terror, the robber watches as the exit of the crypt is being closed off, trapping him. It then switches to present day, where a man with the name of Perry is being released from prison. His girlfriend, PJ, waits for him in a car nearby. Three other girls, Dorian, Adriana, and Morgan, are on their way to go meet them, but need to steal a car. They are driving away when the real owner of the stolen car shoots at them. They cheer as they drive away unscathed, only to realize that Adriana\\'s brother was shot in the head and killed. Although hysterical, they continue to drive to meet the others. They all meet and a thief, Gina, tells them about a \"job of the century\" that would get them easy money. She explains of underground vaults built during the Great Depression that became burial chambers for the wealthy. She shows them a gold ring and tells them there is more treasure hidden in the crypt down below. Equipped with backpacks, tools, two-way radios, and head-mounted flashlights, the group breaks into the north end of the crypt. PJ immediately notices something strange in the crypt when her backpack\\'s contents are taken out after leaving it for only a few seconds. Gina begins to travel ahead to check through the crypt and immediately begins to see ghost-like figures. Regardless, the group open a tomb and take the treasure. When Gina leans to steal off a necklace from one of the skeletons, she jumps in fright, claiming to have seen it \"open its eyes.\" They find several boxes of jewelry and begin to marvel in its excess. When no one is looking, Gina slips a necklace into her bra. Suddenly, they hear something that sounded like an earthquake and realize they are caved in. They try to find another way out but ultimately decide to dig their way out. The three girls decide to turn back while PJ, Perry, and Gina decide to keep going. The girls need to crawl under a wall in order to get back out. However, Morgan decides to climb over and an unstable wall falls on her, crushing her skull and killing her. Shocked by Morgan\\'s death, they decided to crawl back out but Adriana and Dorian saw an undead under the wall trapping them. Adriana starts to panic and Dorian climbs the wall to reach the opening in order to get back out but accidentally falls on the other side leaving Adriana behind. Gina splits off from Perry and PJ, who go into a vault and somehow become locked in. They follow a tunnel that leads to another room. Inside, Perry is attacked by one of the undead. In fear, PJ runs out of the tunnel and out the door that had locked them in before. She locks the door behind her and runs to find the others. PJ goes back to find the others only to find Morgan dead and Adriana trapped on the other side of the unstable wall, while PJ gets Adriana, Gina locates the injured Dorian who broke her ankle and needs assistance in order to walk. The girls meet at a certain point and decide to leave through crawling in a tunnel. However, while crawling through the tunnel, Adriana is dragged away by one of the undead. Adriana\\'s loss makes Dorian depressed. Gina heads to another route to find an exit leaving PJ and Dorian. The undead attacks them and Dorian is choked to death by the same ghost figure that had choked Perry. Gina and PJ continue forward but Gina reluctantly admits that she had been down in the crypts before. She explains that she was unable to find any jewelry and the ghost-like figures had never attacked her before; only watched. They leave behind the backpacks of jewelry and are able to escape through the other exit unscathed. They return to their homes. Gina finds the necklace that she had hid in her bra. She brings it over to PJ\\'s and tries to give it as a gift. However, PJ is furious and tells her to get it out. Gina keeps the bracelet and that night she is killed by the same figure that killed Dorian. PJ has a nightmare that Perry had become one of the undead and decides to go back down the crypts to rescue him. PJ travels back down the crypts until she reaches the door she locked. She opens it and sees Perry, barely alive. PJ begins to put all the jewelry back into its box and asks Perry if it was all the jewelry they had stolen. She then throws the jewelry back into the crypt. She attempts to help Perry out, but he is too weak to walk. When he gestures for her to go without him, she sees a ring on his finger. The ring is from the crypt. Before she could say anything, the undead comes and tortuously kills Perry right before PJ\\'s eyes.',\n",

              " 'Saptapadi deals with the transformation of an individual so devoted to  the concept of rituals, that it takes an act of God  for him to realize the true spirit behind the rituals and true meaning of the prayers. Yajulu is a man of great conviction. According to him rules and customs, that have been passed down generations thus standing the test of the time, are there for a reason and hence are immutable; traditions are trademarks of a culture and customs, its signature. He does not mind losing his daughter for his principles. He is well into his twilight years which give him even more reason to not mend his ways. In his footsteps follows his Gaurinadha , gearing up to be a head priest at the local temple. Yajulu\\'s will prevails over Hema\\'s  wish and Gauri and Hema end up being married. The brilliance of Viswanath comes full fore at this point, when on the first night, Gauri witnesses Durga devi in Hema, and walks out of the room completely shaken up. This act of God triggers Yajulu\\'s thought process to seriously question, for the first time in his life, the validity of his position on matters that involve caste, creed and religion, justifying the steps that Yajulu takes one a time, from the first one in trying to understand Hema\\'s real interests till the last one, when he sees her off with her love interest on the boat. The crux of the whole film is contained in a beautiful conversation that happens between the characters played by Allu Rama Lingaiah and J.V. Somayajulu. Is caste a necessary evil? Is it evil in the first place? If the original idea that \"dharmam\"  dictates the caste of an individual, isn\\'t it abnegation of one\\'s own dharmam when one denounces his own caste? If structure  was the primary reason why caste was created in the first place, isn\\'t it working against the same individual to be caught up completely in the structure that he himself created? Which/Who controls what here? If the duties of the individual cannot make him realize the ultimate purpose of the same, what good is it, if he belongs to the highest order bestowed with the greatest privileges. Consider a brahman diligently offering his prayers on a daily basis, totally immersed in the rituals that traditions and customs dictate. The class of brahman, according to the Smriti, was created to act as a mediator/representative between the rest of the populace and their beliefs, performing the rituals, on their behalf, for the greater good of the society. The class was to bring people closer, in the name of traditions, rituals, customs, and above all, belief. Cleanliness and tidiness help him in concentrating on the task at hand. Now, if he is to stray away from the ultimate purpose of his duty  and instead indulge in the practices of cleanliness and tidiness to the extreme degree, that he starts alienating people in the name of untouchability, he starts moving away from his \"dharmam\", defeating the very purpose of his existence, which brings back the original question - which/who controls what? Is the individual controlling the caste or the caste has a greater say over the individual?',\n",
              " 'The cartoon opens with two castaways adrift on a small raft in the middle of the ocean, underscored with \"Asleep in the Deep\".

Chasing Bugs through the jungle, they spy him, semi-disguised as one of the \"natives\", dancing. Bugs welcomes them with, \"Ah! White Men! Welcome to Humuhumunukunukuapua\\'a\\'a\\'a island.\" He then proceeds to speak in Polynesian-accented nonsense, a long stretch of which is subtitled simply \"What\\'s up Doc?\" and a very short segment is subtitled, \"Now is the time for every good man to come to the aid of his party.\" The tall and skinny man says, \"Well, thanks!\" and the short, fat man, actually seeing the peculiar subtitle, \"Ofa eno maua te ofe popaa\", says, \"Gee, did you say that?\" The skinny man shrugs. Bugs and the two men prepare the feast as they sing \"We\\'re gonna have roast rabbit\" and Bugs realizes he\\'s the roast rabbit and climbs back up his tree and then Bugs tricks them by substituting a skinned chicken for himself in the large cooking pot.

Lena\\'s character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in Stockholm and is driven by a burning passion for social justice and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as \"religion\" and \"men\", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of concentration camps and a portrait of Francisco Franco, reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco\\'s Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena\\'s relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period. Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill , who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic lifestyle, meditating, studying non-violence and practicing yoga. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shot gun, but they soon start to make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They begin to fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of football players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally Martin Luther King, Jr. drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice non-violence. Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has scabies. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sjöman are featured more.

It is what triggers the climax of the film, which sees Sophie and Jeanne seize Georges’ shotguns and murder the family who were watching an opera on television. Jeanne leaves the crime scene and is killed in a car accident by the priest who had fired her from the charity she worked for. Sophie, for her part, walks away from the house after having wiped their fingerprints off the guns, making her way through the police squads going towards the accident. The end credits begin with the music of the opera that is being played back on Melinda’s tape-recorder, which Jeanne stole and put in her car. At the end of the credits, the gunshots can be heard and then the voices of Jeanne and Sophie are the evidence that the police can use to first find the bodies and then convict Sophie. However the film then ends ambiguously. Chabrol presents an ambiguous view of culture and class conflict in this film, which he jokingly called \"the last Marxist film.\"DVDs of the week: The Night of The Shooting Stars, Day of the Dead and more 15 April 2006',\n",

              " 'Emmanuelle flies to Bangkok to meet her husband Jean, a diplomat, who asks her if she had any other lovers while she was in Paris; she replies that she has not. In Bangkok, Emmanuelle finds herself bored and somewhat disgusted with the worldliness of her fellow French expatriates, until one day at a pool when she spies Bee, a Frenchwoman whom she is informed is outside of most of the expatriate circles. After taking a nude swim, she is approached by a pretty young girl named Marie-Ange, who asks to meet Emmanuelle at her house. Intrigued, Emmanuelle agrees. Marie-Ange arrives at the house and finds Emmanuelle sleeping, and takes advantage of the situation to feel the older woman\\'s body. Emmanuelle wakes up and they go outside to the porch. Marie-Ange asks Emmanuelle if she has any photos of herself and Jean having sex, to which an incredulous Emmanuelle replies no. Marie-Ange takes a French magazine with a picture of Paul Newman and begins to masturbate in front of Emmanuelle, who watches, fascinated. Emmanuelle confesses to Marie-Ange that while she did not cheat on her husband in Paris, she did have sex with two strangers on the flight over to Bangkok. Emmanuelle begins to pleasure herself for Marie-Ange as she recounts the tryst. That night, Emmanuelle tells Jean about Marie-Ange, expressing her amazement at the younger girl\\'s seemingly complete lack of shame, and Jean encourages her to pursue the friendship further. During a squash match the next day, Emmanuelle\\'s friend Ariane comments on her being damp from sweat, and begins to feel her up. At a party soon afterwards, Marie-Ange introduces Emmanuelle to one of her older lovers, a gentleman named Mario, who tells her that he will send a car for her the next night, but Emmanuelle is unimpressed. She spies Bee and strikes up a conversation, wishing to meet with Bee in more private quarters. Bee, an archaeologist, tells Emmanuelle that she is leaving the next day for a dig, but tells her to meet her at the klongs. When they meet up at the klongs, Emmanuelle follows Bee around, but Bee is uninterested in playing with Emmanuelle. Undeterred, Emmanuelle gets on Bee\\'s jeep as she is about to leave for the dig site. Back at the house, Jean is angered that Emmanuelle has left without telling him anything. Suspecting that Ariane is behind it, he goes and demands answers from her, but Ariane tells him that all she has to offer is consolation sex. An enraged Jean takes her on a table. At first, Emmanuelle\\'s affair with Bee is on rocky footing; they stop to go skinny-dipping on the way to the dig site, but when Emmanuelle tries to relax next to Bee while they dry off, she brushes her off, saying that they\\'ve already lost time. After reaching the dig site, Bee starts to warm up to her new companion, but throughout the day, Emmanuelle distracts her from her work. They finally make love, but afterwards, Bee asks Emmanuelle to leave. Emmanuelle returns home in tears, feeling humiliated. Jean tries to comfort her, advising her that the best way to get over Bee is to take another lover. At the squash courts the following day, Emmanuelle and Ariane argue. Ariane is jealous that Emmanuelle ran off with Bee, as she herself had hoped to be Emmanuelle\\'s first female lover, while Emmanuelle is displeased at Ariane for having sex with Jean. Ariane protests that it was more like rape than consensual sex, then advises Emmanuelle to meet with Mario, telling her that at his age, making love becomes so difficult that any man capable of it must be an artist. Later, Emmanuelle consults with Jean, who has decided to encourage the relationship between her and Mario by leaving her with him for two days. She expresses a desire to take Marie-Ange as her new lover instead, but Jean informs her that Marie-Ange has gone off on a trip with her parents - a fact that he knows because he has slept with her - and so Emmanuelle resigns herself to a meeting with Mario. At their first dinner together, Mario tells Emmanuelle that monogamy will soon die out. He tells her that she must learn to let lust, rather than guilt or reason, guide her when it comes to sex. This, he says, will lead her to greater levels of pleasure than she ever imagined possible. To begin instilling this lesson in her, he takes her to an opium den, where she is raped by one of the denizens while he watches. Later, Mario takes Emmanuelle to a makeshift boxing ring, where he talks two young men into fighting each other for the right to have sex with her. At Mario\\'s insistence, Emmanuelle chooses one of the men as her favorite, then watches as they fight. Her chosen champion prevails, and she is so aroused by his willingness to fight for her that she licks the blood from a wound on his forehead and then allows him to take her from behind. She soon climaxes and drops to the floor with exhaustion. Sometime later, Emmanuelle is awakened by Mario, who takes her into another room. She is told to undress, so that she can change into a dress with a zipper down the back, allowing Mario to strip her naked in an instant. This, she understands, is in preparation for her next sexual encounter. Emmanuelle protests that she is tired, and asks Mario if he himself will ever have sex with her, to which Mario replies that he is waiting for the \"next Emmanuelle\"  As the movie ends, Emmanuelle sits at a mirror and begins applying makeup, hoping that by following Mario\\'s instructions, she will reach the higher levels of pleasure that he has promised.',\n",

              " 'Renfield  is a solicitor on his way to the Castle belonging to Count Dracula  in Transylvania on a business matter. The people in the local village are fearful that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the local inn and asks the driver of the carriage that brought him to the village to take him to the Borgo Pass. The innkeeper\\'s wife gives Renfield a crucifix for protection before he leaves. He is driven to the castle by Dracula\\'s coach, with Dracula himself disguised as the driver. During the trip, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but is startled to see that the driver has disappeared, and a bat is leading the horses. Renfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a true vampire. They discuss Dracula\\'s intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula then leaves and hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. He faints as a bat appears and Dracula\\'s three wives suddenly appear and start to close in on him. Dracula then arrives and waves them away before he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the schooner Vesta, bound for England, Renfield is now a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship\\'s crew. When the ship arrives in England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person in it; the captain is lashed on the wheel and none of the ship’s crew is discovered. Renfield is sent to Dr. Seward’s sanatorium which is adjoined with Carfax Abbey. Some nights later at a London theatre, Dracula meets Dr. Seward , who is with a group in a box seat area. Seward introduces his daughter Mina , her fiancé John Harker , and the family friend Lucy Weston . Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theatre the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Renfield has become obsessed with eating flies and spiders and Professor Van Helsing  analyzes Renfield\\'s blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon chats with Renfield, who begs Dr. Seward to send him away, because his nightly cries may disturb Mina’s dreams. When Dracula awakes and calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him a branch of wolfbane. Van Helsing says its a plant used for protection from vampires. Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her, leaving neck marks similar to those on Lucy. The next evening, Mina tells of a dream in which she was visited by stranger with \\'red eyes and a white, livid face\\'. Then, Dracula enters for a night\\'s visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that Dracula does not have a reflection in a mirror. When Van Helsing shows this \"most amazing phenomenon\" to Dracula, he reacts violently, smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies. Meanwhile, Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he wraps his cape around her and attacks her. She is found moments later by the mouse maid and Seward, Van Helsing, and Harker retrieve her, while Dracula hides behind a tree. Newspapers report that a \"mysterious, beautiful woman in white\" has been luring children from the park with chocolate, and then biting them. Mina recognizes the beautiful lady as Lucy, who has risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but he is finally convinced to leave Mina with them. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs  to take care of Mina when she is sleeping, and not to remove the wreath of wolfbane from around her neck. Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the three men discussing vampires. Before Martin , his attendant, arrives to take Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to Van Helsing, Harker and Seward how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that because he has fused his blood with Mina\\'s, she now belongs to him. Van Helsing swears revenge by excavating Carfax Abbey and finding the coffin where he sleeps; he will then thrust a stake through his heart. Dracula tries to hypnotize Van Helsing, but without success. Van Helsing shows a crucifix to the vampire and Dracula turns away and flees the house. Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and Mina speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". Harker notices Mina’s changes, not realizing that she is slowly transforming into a vampire.

              " 'After miraculously recovering from a bullet wound to the head, Gulf War veteran Jack Starks  returns to Vermont in 1992, suffering from periods of amnesia. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie , and her mother  in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman. The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman\\'s gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution. Starks is subjected to the experiments of Dr. Thomas Becker , a psychiatrist. In December 1992 Starks is injected with experimental drugs, forcibly bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie  at a roadside diner where she works. This happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. Seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and questions her. Jackie tells him that Jack Starks died on 1 January 1993 and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning her trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life. Early on 1 January 1993, knowing his time is fast running out, Starks slips out of the hospital and travels to the home of Jackie and her mother. He gives the mother a letter he has written. The letter outlines Jackie\\'s bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a cigarette and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks slips on ice and hits his head; bleeding profusely, he convinces two hospital doctors, who are sympathetic to him, to put him into the jacket one last time. Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007 - no longer a waitress, she\\'s dressed in a nurse\\'s uniform and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother — still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the \"previous\" future is not lost when Jackie says \"How much time do we have?\", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question is given by the words of the song: \"We have all the time in the world\".',\n",

Lila Loomis , sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken back to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond , who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel\\'s new manager, Warren Toomey . The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool . One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels , a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend\\'s place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable establishment before Norman was committed into a sleazy adult motel. Norman\\'s adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls came from someone claiming to be Norman\\'s mother. The next day, drunk Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Back at the motel Toomey yells hysterically up to the house at Norman saying he\\'s moving out. Later, a human figure in a black dress walks in and slashed his face and stabs him to death with a large kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. As Norman begins to reconstruct his motel, he begins to doubt his sanity when he spots a human figure staring out of the upstairs window resembling his mother. Shocked by this, Norman runs into the house and enters his mother\\'s bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. At the same time, a teenage couple, believing the house to be abandoned, sneaks in through the cellar window. As they were making out, they noticed a human female figure dressed in black pacing in the next room and heading towards the cellar trapdoor with a large kitchen knife. The girl tries to climb through a small window, but knocks over a pile of logs. As they try to climb out, the window slams down on his hands and the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic, but the door is unlocked confusing Norman. Minutes later, the sheriff arrives at the house and questions them about the boy\\'s murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It\\'s starting again!\"; Norman is aware that he is slipping into insanity again. That evening, Mary goes down to the motel to look for a bottle of brandy. In the parlour she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary\\'s mother and ask her why she alibied for him. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother; Mary has also been helping her. She was the figure Norman spotted in the window, and also restored mother\\'s room in the house plus locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and to have him recommitted. Mary\\'s growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience, leaving her to reconsider her actions. Lila becomes annoyed at Mary for giving an alibi to the police, because she is desperate for Bates to be recommitted. Mary, however, believes Norman to be innocent and states there could be somebody else lurking in the house. As she leaves, Lila warns her that Norman will eventually kill her just like the rest. As Norman enters the bathroom he calls for Mary, and the two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet and overflowing. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary tells Norman it could not have been him as he was in the attic, and tells Norman to make them both a drink. As Mary cleans up the mess, she is startled when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She screams and then calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. Mary then returns to her room to fetch her gun, which she has been keeping in her bag, and enters Norman\\'s mother\\'s bedroom. As she enters, she discovers a peephole behind a painting and looks through and finds somebody else staring at her through the bathroom wall. Norman rushes to her aid but is sad to learn that Mary has a gun, thinking it is because of him she carries it, which Mary denies. Norman goes downstairs into the kitchen, grabs a butcher knife for protection, and goes into the hallway to search for the intruder. As he walks towards the stairs he is shocked to hear a faint voice coming from the cellar calling his name. Norman then runs into Mary\\'s room and locks the door stating his mother is downstairs waiting to kill Mary. Mary tells him his mother is dead but Norman states he was wrong and that she is alive. Mary, who to herself thinks Lila is tormenting him, tries to convince him to confront her, but Norman refuses, claiming it is too dangerous, and tells her that he will protect her through the night. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary\\'s identity as Lila\\'s daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates  to be exhumed, to prove that Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila\\'s ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila will not stop. Mary goes to Lila\\'s hotel and tells her to leave Norman alone, mentioning the bloodied cloth and the peephole. Lila states her innocence, claiming she returned to her hotel after seeing Mary and their argument is overheard by a desk clerk. Lila tells Mary to dress up as \"Mother\" one last time to send him over the edge, which she refuses. Later, Lila drives over to Norman\\'s house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another human figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and shoves a knife into Lila\\'s mouth. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house; Lila\\'s body is not in the cellar and the \"Mother\" figure is gone. Norman enters the cellar and Dr. Raymond tells him about Lila and leaves the house to try and prove to Norman that Mary and Lila are the ones tormenting him. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, stunk with Toomey\\'s dead body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him hysterically. The phone rings in the house. Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\" but it\\'s actually Dr. Raymond who is calling Norman from the motel parlour telling him Lila used the office phone to place the calls but Norman believes he is still talking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified that Norman has slipped back into insanity, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman and arms herself with a large butcher knife. She picks up the phone and tells Norman she\\'s his mother and tells him to hang up. Dr. Raymond sneaks up and grabs her from behind as she is on top of the stairs calling out for Norman. She screams and plunges the knife into Dr. Raymond as he falls down the stairs to his death as the knife squishes into him further. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a completely deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother.\" A fearful Mary grabs the knife out of Dr. Raymond\\'s body and warns Norman to stay away from her. Norman keeps walking towards her even after being repeatedly stabbed in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila\\'s body hidden behind it. A shocked Mary is now convinced that Norman has been committing the murders. Norman denies doing any of the killings and thinks \"Mother\" committed them. She raises her knife to stab him but is shot dead by one of the incoming police deputies. The sheriff inaccurately places a story to the authorities believing Mary committed all the murders and killed Lila to protect Norman. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates\\' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool\\'s body upstairs to Mother\\'s room and we hear Mother\\'s voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers. Thunder is heard and Mother watches from the window upstairs.',\n",

              " 'The film begins in the Elizabethan Age shortly before the death of Queen Elizabeth I. On her deathbed, Elizabeth promises an androgynous young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it along with a generous monetary gift which she will only bequeath to him if he consents to her command, \"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\" Both he and his heirs will keep the land and inheritance forever. Orlando acquiesces and resides in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries or so during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet, however, backfire when the poet writes a devastating takedown of his poetry. Orlando then travels to Constantinople as British ambassador to the Turks, but he is almost killed in a diplomatic fracas there. Waking up the next morning, however, he learns something even more startling: he has physically transformed into a woman overnight. The now \\'Lady\\' Orlando comes home to her estate in Middle Eastern garb, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman to begin with and therefore has no right to the land or any of her/his royal inheritance. The succeeding two centuries tire her out; the court case, bad luck in love and the wars of British history eventually bring her up to the 1990s with a young daughter in tow and a book in search of a publisher.

              " 'The film opens as Ben, Gwen, and Kevin are negotiating with a group of black market dealers, who are attempting to sell them alien nanochips. One of them reveals herself to be Elena, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen and a fellow Plumber\\'s kid. Elena explains that she had set up the negotiations to lure Ben out into the open, and explains that her father has been abducted and that she needs their help to find him. Just as Ben agrees to help her, the chips suddenly spring to life, controlled by a man hiding in the rafters. Kevin sees it as a double cross, though Elena insists that she is not responsible. While the dealers escape, Ben transforms into Big Chill and drives off the intruder. Elena escapes in the confusion, further justifying Kevin\\'s suspicions. Though Gwen quickly sides with Kevin, Ben is not as easily convinced. Arriving at their headquarters underneath the Bellwood auto repair shop, the trio, along with Grandpa Max, study the chips, learning that they are a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in; Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena\\'s father, Victor Validus, was an apprentice of his who was dishonorably discharged after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her. While Max is away, Gwen and Kevin hack into the computer files relating to Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that \"the Hive\", the hive mind intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet. Realizing that Max\\'s anger towards Victor\\'s betrayal may be clouding his judgment, Gwen and Kevin decide to aid Ben as well. Meanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor\\'s old laboratory. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they left Ship-It order slips behind. Other discarded files indicate that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips, and a picture shows Elena is close to the person controlling them. A mob under the control of the chips attack Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, having found an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks. Gwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips\\' control. He has a chip swarm attack Gwen and Kevin, which eventually wreck Kevin\\'s car  after a lengthy chase. Ben, overhearing the commotion and following them, uses Humongousaur  to defeat the swarm, completely demolishing Kevin\\'s car in the process. By the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. The group deduces that there must be a Queen  controlling the Hive, and by destroying her they will likely destroy the chips as well. During their search for the queen, however, one of the chips takes over Max. Pulling together, the group notices an anomaly in the chip distribution; while world population centers are all infected, the relatively remote Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration. The town is home to the central headquarters of Ship-It. With Kevin\\'s car out of commission, Kevin reveals that he has built a black and green car for Ben , called DX Mark 10  as a \"late birthday present.\" Infiltrating the factory, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena\\'s father and his body is being used to mass produce the chips; when questioned, Elena admits that she knew her father was the Queen\\'s host all along, but didn\\'t tell them because she feared they wouldn\\'t believe her just as the Plumbers didn\\'t believe Victor. Gwen and Kevin reluctantly suggest killing Victor to stop the Hive, but Ben and Elena refuse to consider it. Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls \"Nanomech\"  which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips. He enters Victor\\'s brain and battles the queen while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the drones. After a grueling battle, Nanomech electrocutes the Queen, and all of the other chips, freeing everybody from their control. In the aftermath, Max, after personally apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so.

While waiting, Ringo also has to deal with Hunt Bromley , the young local would-be gunslinger who is keen to make a name for himself, and Jerry Marlowe , a semi-retired man who mistakenly believes Ringo killed his son some years before. Ringo also meets another friend from the past, a bargirl named Molly , who eventually persuades Peggy to come and talk to her husband. Meeting at last, Ringo tells his wife that he has changed, that he wants to settle down somewhere where people do not know him, possibly out in California, and asks her to leave with him. She refuses, but agrees to reconsider in a year\\'s time if he will remain true to his word. Ringo also gets acquainted with his son at last, although he does not tell him of their relationship. By now however, Ringo has spent too long in town. The three brothers are still trailing him and arrive, but are captured before they can ambush Ringo. As Ringo makes final preparations to leave, Bromley seizes his chance. Eager to get himself a reputation as a gunfighter, Bromley shoots Ringo in the back, fatally wounding him. As Ringo lies dying he tells Sheriff Strett to say that he, rather than Bromley, drew first. When Bromley starts to say that he doesn\\'t want Ringo\\'s help, Ringo rejects Bromley\\'s words, informing his killer that he will soon know how it feels to have every hotshot and two-bit gunfighter out to get him in turn. An angry Strett tells Bromley to leave town immediately, and punctuates his order with a severe beating which he warns is \"just the beginning\" of what he\\'s got coming to him for killing Ringo. It is clear that Bromley will quickly discover  that notoriety as a gunfighter is in reality a curse which will follow him wherever he goes, making him both an outcast and a target for the rest of his life. The film closes with Peggy Walsh attending Jimmy Ringo\\'s funeral, making her way through the crowd around the church door with her son to reveal, quietly but with pride, what the townsfolk have never known&nbsp;– that she is Mrs Jimmy Ringo. Thus, despite his death, the gunfighter finally achieves what he sought in coming to the town&nbsp;– his wife\\'s forgiveness and reconciliation.',\n",

              " 'In a cat-filled mausoleum in Central City, Denny Colt , also known as The Spirit, receives a call from Detective Sussman  about a major case that could involve the Spirit\\'s arch-nemesis, The Octopus . The Spirit dons his costume and travels across rooftops while delivering a voice-over soliloquy about the city being his one true love. A woman  is being mugged in an alley below. He manages to save her, receiving a knife wound that he barely seems to notice. The woman asks, \"What are you?\" The Spirit runs away, catching a ride from Officer Liebowitz ([[Frank Miller  and heading toward the flats. At the swampland, femme fatale Sand Saref  rises from the water and appears to shoot Sussman multiple times. The Spirit and Liebowitz find the wounded Sussman, but a flashback reveals that it was really the Octopus who shot him in an effort to recover two identical chests underwater. Sand and her husband Mahmoud  tried to flee with both chests, but the Octopus wounded Mahmoud and snapped a line connecting the two chests. Sand escaped, leaving one chest behind, which the Octopus retrieved from the murky depths. After the Octopus kills Liebowitz by ripping his head off, he sends away his cloned henchmen, Ethos, Pathos, and Logos , to take on the Spirit alone. His accomplice Silken Floss  drives up, running over Pathos in the process. She departs with the cargo, taking the view that the Spirit and the Octopus will \"be at it all night\" as the two enemies share a connection in their ability to resist physical injury. The Spirit is awakened by his lover Dr. Ellen Dolan , daughter of Police Commissioner Dolan . Appearing to be in perfect health despite his gunshot wounds , the Spirit is shocked to notice a gold locket in Sussman\\'s hand; a piece torn from Sand Saref’s neck earlier. Saref\\'s locket contains pictures of a much-younger Denny Colt  and Sand ; the two grew up together in Central City where Denny bought Sand the locket as a gift to satisfy her love of \"shiny things\", including the Golden Fleece of Jason and the Argonauts. They lived happily until Sand\\'s father was shot dead. Sand, who now hated cops, fled to Europe and has not been heard from for fifteen years. In a secret lair, the Octopus and Silken Floss open the chest, but discover that it does not contain the mysterious Blood of Heracles as expected and decide a trade is in order. Sand and Mahmoud visit the office of a high-class fence named Donenfeld , whom Sand paid to locate the underwater treasure. It is implied that Donenfeld gave up the treasure\\'s location to the Octopus to ensure his family\\'s safety. At Alice\\'s Hospital, the Spirit has fully regenerated and is as good as new; Commissioner Dolan angrily enters with young rookie cop Morgenstern  and calls the Spirit away to a case. Sand\\'s history as one of the world\\'s great jewel thieves is relayed to the Spirit. As the Spirit is about to arrest her, he is caught off-guard by her standing before him fully nude. Sand doesn\\'t recognize the Spirit as the presumed-dead Denny. She is stunned when he reveals his knowledge of her looking for the Golden Fleece as she shoves the Spirit through a window only to see him survive the fall. Octopus and Floss\\'s experimentation have led to the creation of a serum  that could grant immortality with which the Octopus injected himself and arch-enemies were born. After surviving the fall, the Spirit receives a tip on the location of the Octopus\\'s lair. Unable to break in unnoticed, he is captured and tied to a dentist\\'s chair. The Octopus reveals his own origin as well as how he and the Spirit became arch-enemies. Eventually the Spirit manages to escape, but not without sustaining a critical blow. The Spirit stumbles to the city docks and collapses into the water where he confronts the ethereal Angel of Death, Lorelei Rox , who has haunted his sleep. He becomes the only man to have ever wrongfully escaped death when he manages to gather his senses by remembering Ellen, Sand, and the city all needing him. As the Spirit swims to the surface, Lorelei vows vengeance. At the projects, Sand and her latest henchman fly in with the Blood of Heracles to meet Floss and a clone carrying the Golden Fleece. After a four-way Mexican standoff, Sand attempts to convince Floss to get out of serving the Octopus before she is killed by the Octopus himself. He asks Floss for the vase. Unable to take a side, Floss drives off as the Spirit suddenly materializes. The Octopus unloads with progressively bigger guns on the Spirit, apparently killing him off, but Dolan\\'s SWAT team storms the area and opens fire right after. Morgenstern blows the Octopus\\' arm up with a handcannon, to recover from the damage, the Octopus gets to the Blood of Heracles and prepares to drink it, but Sand shoots the vase just in time as the Spirit comes back from the dead, having used a bulletproof vest, and attach a grenade to the Octopus\\' chest, blowing him up into pieces, with Sand protecting the two of them with the Golden Fleece. Showdown over, the Spirit gives Sand her locket back. They kiss as Ellen looks on, feeling betrayed. The old flames bid each other goodbye and the Spirit convinces Dolan to let Sand go in gratitude for saving the world. Elsewhere, Floss discovers the Octopus’s severed finger crawling toward her. She picks it up and departs saying, \"we\\'ll start from scratch\". At dawn, the Spirit stands triumphant on a rooftop with his cat.',\n",

              " 'Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball take turns providing voice-over narration throughout—and in at least one scene, Van Johnson talks directly to the camera , as does Fonda. Frank Beardsley is a Roman Catholic Navy warrant officer, recently detached from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and assigned as project officer for the Fresnel lens glide-slope indicator, or \"meatball,\" that would eventually become standard equipment on all carriers. Helen North is a Roman Catholic nurse working in the dispensary at the California naval base to which Frank is assigned. Frank meets Helen, first by chance in the commissary on the Naval base  and then when Frank brings his distraught teen-age daughter for treatment at the dispensary, where Helen informs him that the young lady is simply growing up in a too-crowded house that lacks a mother\\'s guidance. They immediately hit it off and go on a date, all the while shying away from admitting their respective secrets: Frank has ten children and Helen has eight, from previous marriages that ended in their spouses\\' deaths. When each finally learns the other\\'s secret, they initially resist their mutual attraction. But Chief Warrant Officer Darrell Harrison  is determined to bring them together. To that end, he \"fixes up\" each of them with a blind date that is sure to be incompatible. Helen\\'s date is an obstetrician ([[Sidney Miller  who stands a good head shorter than she; this prompts Helen to observe in voice-over, \"Darrell had a malicious sense of humor.\" Frank\\'s date is a \"hip\" girl  who is not only young enough to be one of his daughters, but also is far too forward for his taste. As the final touch, Harrison makes sure that both dates take place in the same Japanese restaurant. As Harrison fully expects, Frank and Helen end up leaving the restaurant together in his car, with Frank\\'s date sitting uncomfortably between the two as they carry on about their children. Frank and Helen continue to date regularly, and eventually he invites her for dinner in his home. This turns nearly disastrous when Mike, Rusty, and Greg , Frank\\'s three sons, mix hefty doses of gin, scotch, and vodka into Helen\\'s drink. As a result Helen behaves in a wild and embarrassing manner, which Frank cannot comprehend until he catches his sons trying to conceal their laughter. \"The court of inquiry is now in session!\" he declares, and gets the three to own up and apologize. After this, he announces his intention to marry, adding, \"And nobody put anything into my drink.\" Most of the children fight the union at first, regarding each other and their respective stepparents with suspicion. Eventually, however, the eighteen children bond into one large blended family, about to become a little larger when Helen becomes pregnant. Further tension develops between young Philip North and his teacher at the parochial school that he attends, because his teacher insists that he use his \"legal\" name . This prompts Frank and Helen to discuss cross-adopting one another\\'s children. At first the children  are aghast at the notion of \"reburying\" their respective deceased biological parents. Yet the subsequent birth of Joseph John Beardsley finally unites the children, and they agree unanimously to the adoption under a common surname. The film ends with Mike Beardsley, the eldest, going off to Camp Pendleton to begin his stint in the United States Marine Corps.',\n",

              " 'Situated in a facsimile of London\\'s Christmas Square, the special is co-hosted by Rex , an erudite and intellectual tyrannosaurus, and Herb , a dimwitted, bespectacled styracosaurus with a voracious appetite. Some critics have cited similarities between these two characters and film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Recurring characters in Vinton\\'s films dating back to 1980, Rex and Herb introduce several stand-alone videos of Christmas carols and standards and discuss the origins of each song relating to different holiday traditions around the world. The songs featured were: * \"We Three Kings\" by the Three Wise Men and their doo-wop-singing camels * \"Carol of the Bells\" performed at Notre Dame Cathedral under the direction of Maestro Quasimodo by The Paris Bell-Harmonic, a group of anthropomorphic church bells who strike themselves in the head with hammers to achieve their respective notes * \"O Christmas Tree\" performed by a children\\'s choir, showing various scenes taking place inside of Christmas ornaments * \"Angels We Have Heard On High\", an instrumental version of the carol with an interpretive ice ballet performed by a pair of walruses and six penguins. * \"Joy to the World\", a soulful rendition of the carol featuring images depicting African-American culture * \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" sung by the California Raisins  * \"Here We Come A-Wassailing\" sung by the entire cast Throughout the program, Rex futilely attempts to clarify the true pronunciation and meaning of the term \\'wassail\\', featured in the Christmas carol Here We Come A-Wassailing. As the show progresses, Rex is dismayingly accosted by different groups singing the song, though each version is lyrically incorrect. *Here We Come a-Waffling, sung by a kennel of dogs selling waffles from a vendors wagon. *Here We Come a-Waddling, by a gaggle of straggling geese carrying baskets of goodies. *Here We Come a-Wallowing, by a herd of slovenly pigs on a field wagon gorging themselves on an abundance of assorted fruits.  Though Rex is convinced his own definition is correct, he finds himself continually being questioned by the others, including Herb when he\\'s not busy excessively partaking of the various Christmas treats offered by each group. Finally, near the program\\'s end, a large truck loaded with cider-swilling townsfolk arrives on the scene, singing the correct version of the carol, validating Rex\\'s theories much to his delight. After one of the townies explains the real meaning of wassailing—going around the neighborhood singing Christmas Carols, and getting treats and cordials, the entire cast performs Here We Come A-wassailing, and then We Wish You a Merry Christmas as the end credits roll.

              " 'The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 460. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar\\'s sword, Ambrosinus has then become Romulus\\'s tutor. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \"magic\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus\\'s father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \"Aurelius\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius\\'s men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer\\'s lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. Next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus\\'s help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue\\'s feet proclaims the sword was made for \"he who is destined to rule\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the Eastern Roman Empire - a Keralite warrior named Mira . They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire\\'s emissary  and the senator Nestor have promised safe passage to Constantinople. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer. Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in Britain, where the Ninth Legion  may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar\\'s sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the Alps and the English Channel, the party travels to Hadrian\\'s Wall and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commander. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonize the powerful warlord Vortgyn. During their stay in the small Celtic village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named Igraine. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was. Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith\\'s wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife\\'s and sons\\' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian\\'s Wall to face Vortgyn\\'s armies in one final battle. Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armor which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar\\'s sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn\\'s forces at Hadrian\\'s Wall. Aurelius, his men, and the archers pelted the infantry with arrows, while Mira, Romulus, and several Roman and Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the enemy at the gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn\\'s soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear and turn the tide. The two warring sides cease their hostilities when Ambrosinus confronts and burns Vortgyn alive at a tree-sanctuary of his secret brotherhood near the battlefield. Romulus kills Wulfila with Caesar\\'s sword, avenging his parents. He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon. Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, Merlin, takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name \"Pendragon\". The boy, Arthur, recognizes Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother. In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the Latin letters which, when read as a single word, read Excalibur.',\n",
              " ' In a post-apocalyptic setting, following a global war and the collapse of civilization after the Earth\\'s oil supplies were nearly exhausted, barbaric anarchy has become the world\\'s everyday law. Max Rockatansky, traumatised by the death of his family, roams the desert in a scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special, scavenging for food and petrol. His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog, and a rare functioning firearm – a sawn-off shotgun – for which ammunition is very scarce. After driving off a gang of marauders led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, Max collects the petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles and moves on to check a nearby autogyro for fuel. The autogyro is boobytrapped, but Max overpowers the pilot hiding nearby; in exchange for his own life, the pilot tells Max about a small oil refinery nearby in the wasteland. Max arrives just as the marauders, a motley collection of cars and motorbikes, besiege the compound. Their leader, a large, muscular man with a hockey mask over his disfigured face called \"The Humungus\", tries to convince the settlers to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of his territory. A group of settlers attempt to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, rape and kill them. Max makes a deal with the remaining survivor, mortally wounded: bring the settler back to the compound in exchange for a tank of petrol. The man dies shortly after Max returns him, and the settlers\\' leader reneges on the deal; the settlers are on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return, and Humungus repeats his offer. Max offers another deal to Papagallo: he will retrieve an abandoned Mack semi-truck, capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the settlers use to store the fuel they refine, in exchange for petrol and his freedom. The settlers accept, but keep his car. Max sneaks out, joining forces with the autogyro pilot. Max drives the semi back to the compound, evading Humungus\\' men. The settlers want Max to escape with the group, but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave. However, his attempt to break through the siege fails: Wez gives chase in The Humungus\\'s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off of the road, wrecking his Pursuit Special and seriously wounding him. The marauders kill Max\\'s dog with a crossbow and attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special\\'s tanks, but trigger an explosive booby trap that destroys the car. Max is left for dead, but the gyro pilot rescues him and flies him back to the compound. Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound in the now heavily armored truck, accompanied by a feral child he has befriended, and with several settlers in armored vehicles providing protection. The Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan. Papagallo and the settlers defending the tanker are killed during the chase, and the gyro captain is shot down. Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against the marauders, who continue their pursuit. Wez boards the truck to kill the two, but a head-on collision with Humungus\\' car kills both Wez and Humungus. Max loses control of the tanker, and it rolls off the road. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the tank. The truck and its trailer are revealed to be a decoy, allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles. With Papagallo dead, the gyro captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the \"Great Northern Tribe\". Max remains alone in the desert, once again becoming a drifter, leaving the Feral Kid  reminiscing about him.',\n",

              " 'Benjamin Jahrvi  has moved to New York City where he is selling toy versions of Johnny 5 on the street. Struggling department store buyer Sandy Banatoni  sees the toys and orders 1,000 units. Ben is helped by con artist Fred Ritter  with the project. Fred borrows money from a loan shark for equipment, hires temporary workers and rents a warehouse to build the toys. Unfortunately, the warehouse is the base of operations for a couple of thieves hired by bank teller Oscar Baldwin  to tunnel into the bank vault across the street. They plan to steal a set of jewels known as the Vanderveer Collection, worth $37,862,000. The thieves try to scare off Ben and Fred, trashing their equipment and chasing away their temps which makes it impossible to meet the deadline. A large crate arrives from Ben\\'s friends Stephanie and Newton, containing Johnny 5, sent to help Ben with his business. Johnny can build the toys rapidly, giving Ben time to study for his U.S. citizen\\'s test. Considering Johnny\\'s thirst for data, Fred is sworn not to reveal their location to Johnny, believing that the robot would go nuts if he knew he was living in a major metropolis. When Fred accidentally lets it slip to Johnny that he is in the city, the robot leaves the warehouse to explore the city, annoys everyone, and inadvertently makes friends with Oscar himself. Fred, having learned that Johnny is worth $11,002,076.17, tries to sell the robot to a few businessmen. When Johnny learns that Fred plans to sell him, he escapes and wanders through the city. Johnny soon realizes just how lonely he is because of his inability to convince anyone that he is alive. Johnny is later found and retrieved by Ben from the police\\'s stolen-goods warehouse after being put there for trashing a book store for input. The two have a heart-to-heart conversation, and Johnny encourages Ben to ask Sandy out on a proper date. After an awkward start, Ben and Sandy make a connection. The thieves, pressed for time, lock Ben and Fred in the freezer of a Chinese restaurant, while Oscar persuades the overly trusting Johnny to help finish the tunnel leading to the bank. Johnny completes the tunnel, breaks into the safe, and unlocks the safe deposit box that holds the Vanderveer Collection. Johnny figures out Oscar\\'s true intentions, but after being chased through the city, he is savagely attacked and severely damaged by the thieves causing his system to malfunction. Although Johnny manages to get away, he is leaking battery fluid and losing power, a condition that will kill him in two hours unless proper repairs can be made. Ben and Fred manage to escape from the freezer with Sandy\\'s help, but when they return to the warehouse, Ben and Sandy are captured by the police mistaking them as being the ones responsible for the robbery. Fred escapes, though, and attempts to find Johnny. After a long search, Fred finds Johnny in an alleyway. Fred is startled by how damaged Johnny is, and helps patch him up enough to reconnect his main battery and memory, just enough for Johnny to make the remaining repairs himself. It isn\\'t until Johnny learns from Fred that he and Ben were locked up in a freezer, that the robot becomes enraged at the fact that they were simply locked up and he was attacked by Oscar\\'s gang after being merely used and seeks vengeance on Oscar. Despite his injuries, Johnny is determined to bring Oscar and his gang to justice. After a chase he corners them at a construction site near the Hudson River. Oscar\\'s gang is captured, but Oscar himself flees by stealing a boat. Johnny uses a crane to capture Oscar from the moving boat, who is then arrested and the diamonds are returned. The effort drains Johnny\\'s remaining power reserves and kills him, causing Ben  to frantically use a defibrillator in an effort to save Johnny. Ben succeeds, and manages to keep the robot running long enough to make full repairs. The final scenes show Johnny has become a celebrity, his face on the front pages of newspapers and magazines everywhere. As a result of this newfound fame, his look-alike toys have become a hot commodity, allowing Sandy, Ben, and Fred to go into business for themselves. The film concludes with Ben becoming a US citizen, which he shares with a newly-restored and gold-plated Johnny, officially recognized as a living, thinking citizen with all the associated rights and privileges. Asked how he felt about his new status, Johnny enthusiastically jumps into the air, shouting that he feels \"alive!\"',\n",

His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter\\'s phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man\\'s suitability for a relationship — which reveals that he is a \"Ditchable Dude.\" In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal\\'s eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw — whom he had previously thought of as loose-moraled  and slovenly — appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter\\'s Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \"What women want\" from a man — evidently it is for them to \"listen, listen, listen.\" With the help of the advice gleaned from the pages of Cosmopolitan, and to some extent in spite of it, Gopal and Mrs. Shaw  hit it off, and develop a warm, tender, intimate relationship. Mrs. Shaw is a high school counselor, and therefore a good and empathetic listener herself, and Gopal confides in her about his childhood dreams and sorrows.

              " 'The first part of the film\\'s story takes place in the year 1700 on an island called Casanga off the west coast of Africa. The island has not yet attracted the attention of the slave traders on the mainland, but its people are suffering fierce oppression under their hereditary queen Zinga - a tyrant, despot, and mistress of cruelty. What first appears on screen is a grassland landscape in which men of an African tribe are patrolling, with haystacks and rugged hills in the background. Into this scene there comes a bare-chested young African, as strong as a bull, looking around him cautiously. Next we see the brutal Queen Zinga, wearing a leopard-skin dress, a straw hat, and a shell necklace on which hangs a medallion, a symbol of kingship. Laughing vigorously, she is teasing a man tied on a wooden column, who is supposed to be the king of Casanga. Zinga takes off the necklace and puts it on the man\\'s neck, taunting him as a \"one-second king\" and trying to kill him straight away. Suddenly, a girl, apparently frustrated by the cruelty of the planned execution, rushes towards the queen, grabs the medallion, and runs off. Astonished, the queen orders her soldiers to catch the fleeing girl and to recover the medallion. However, with the help of the strong young man seen at the beginning of the film, she is able to escape from the soldiers and the two get onto a raft to row it to the mainland. Once there, they turn to a white slave-trader for help. The slaver happily accepts them into his camp and adds them to his chain. Then, along with all the other blacks the slaver has acquired, the couple is filled with anxiety and fear. Sent to England by boat to begin their new life, they are not sure what is in store for them. Time runs on and historical events unfoldd, such as the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807. But not until 1833 did the slaves themselves are free from the oppressing situation and the social status for blacks start to improve. Chains and handcuffs are destroyed, ropes and whips are burned, and a seemingly brand new story begins, centring on John Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. His singing impresses all his colleagues on the wharf. Children in his apartment block fall asleep soundly when he sings, but he himself doesn’t realized what use he can make use of his voice. In fact, what keeps hovering in his mind is the eagerness to discover his true origins and to help his own people, although he doesn’t know who they are. Zinga always considers himself out of place in London and is often blamed by his wife for being ‘not satisfied’, but never does he change his mind. Finally, one day an opera impresario hears him singing and tries his best to find out about him. And in a pub, while Zinga is being invited by the owner to sing the song \"Lonely Road\", Gabriel Donizetti, the famous impresario, comes quietly in from the door and sits in the audience, watching, listening, and enjoying the beautiful song. \"No more docker, but a great career\" Donizetti promises Zinga, who is shocked and surprised since he thinks he can achieve his dream of travelling back to Africa by this chance. They shake hand with each other and Donizetti leaves a card for Zinga to come to his hotel room the next day. Zinga can’t wait to go. The next day he dresses in a suit, apparently for the first time since he both walks and acts in a lame and inappropriate way. Zinga\\'s wife is also with him to deal with the hotel managers. In the end they find the way to Donizetti’s room and he starts a series of tests and introduces several skills to help Zinga to improve his singing. At first Zinga is reluctant to accept these instructions, like ‘breathing from the stomach’ and ‘singing from the breast’, claiming that he knows how to sing. And he fights against singing in a suit, since he doesn’t feel ‘free’. His voice significantly lacks emotion compared to when he sings freely with friends and in a pub about his homeland in Africa. But after his wife’s comforting, mainly focussing on the chance of travelling back to Africa, he is persuaded to follow those doctrinaire rules and techniques. After long training and practice, Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas. This brings him wealth and fame that he has never dreamt of. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, always being sarcastic towards his slave-born identity as his being referred as the Negro King. One day after a great performance, Zinga is instructed to give a speech about what he feels about his success. Not good at public speaking, he sings an old song derived from his long lost childhood memory that he barely remembers and has to put some words into it. In the song, he himself is regarded as a ‘wanderer’ and ‘hears the cold fell by his people’. John has a feeling that by singing the song he may find out some information about his origins, which means much to him. The result does not fail him. The song is moving and invokes one of the audience’s memories about the song. He comes to the dressing room at the back of the stage and talk to John about what he knows. John then finds out that his ancestor belongs to the island of Casanga, located on the west coast of Africa. The man from the audience, Pele, was the only white man to escape from the island since it was dominated by a brutal queen, and it is now ruled by a wicked witch doctor. And the song John sang was the secret song passed on by every king, regarded as the \"Song of Freedom\" of the Casanga people. Pele also tells Zinga the medallion hanging on his neck, which he got from his father and his father had from his great-grandfather, is the symbol of the kingship-----he, John Zinga, is the king of his people. Hearing that his people are still uncivilized on the island, Zinga’s idea of going back to his homeland to help his people became even more fixed. At this time Donizetti happens to come in and tells John some good news - a new contract to work in the great New York City Zinga refuses to go to New York to carry on his singing career since he considers his people bigger than his success. Donizetti is mad about Zinga leaving his career, but cannot stop him from crossing the ocean to come to the little island in Africa. When Zinga arrives on the island he, his wife and a servant are not trusted by the aboriginals, even though they have the same skin color and Zinga has the medallion which proves him the king, he and his fellows are still considered out-comers, strangers or even bad guys coming from the whites’ country. That’s far from Zinga’s expectation, which lets him down for a time. His servant wants to resign and tell him to give up, even himself thinks the place is too primitive and his people are too hard to change. But his wife stands on his side and encourages him ‘the worse things are, the more you can change.’ Soon he cheers up and waits for his chance in a shabby dome. And it comes. Zinga found out that the witch doctor locks patients up instead of treating them for the lack of medicine. The witch doctor also announces that when a person gets sick - no matter a fever or cancer - he’s dead rather than ill. To deal with this inhuman act, Zinga gives the patient Penicillin and tries to heal them. Some of the people start to believe in Zinga. They tell him “I’m your man, but you can be no king.” But this doesn’t last long when the witch doctor began to form various rituals to cast the ‘disaster’ the out comers brought to the island. What’s worse is that the people’s trust on Zinga diminishes since the patients he tried to cure all die. To break the superstition Zinga interrupts the rites, attempting to show that no taboos are going to act on him, but is scolded by the crowds. Therefore the witch doctor come up with a task of bring the rain. He claims that by rituals he can always bring rains to the island, then the gods and ghosts will be satisfied and cast no disaster and diseases to the men and women; yet Zinga points out frankly that the cause of disease is the bacteria and germs in the river and he cannot bring rains but he can help saving the rain. And he begins to illustrate the amazing life brought by technology improvement from the other side of the ocean. With the help of his followers, more and more and people of the clan believe in him. The witch doctor is so angry that he jumps up and down to try to scare people from getting in touch with Zinga. While they are debating, Zinga’s wife ran out and shouted to the witch doctor to support her husband. But that violate the taboo of not letting women to join the ritual and the witch doctor feels perfectly justified to put Zinga’s wife in the basement. Zinga, who tried to protect his wife, is also tied up by the army. They are going to execute both of them the next day. And by the moonlight, Zinga’s wife sang miserably to him to show her dismay. Zinga’s followers bring him his gun but he refuses it. He determines not to use force to hurt his people but convince them in other way. Next day the ritual is being held. The witch doctor performs different kinds of tricks, such as fire swallowing to intimidate his people, so that Zinga’s followers are afraid to rescue them. Both Zinga and his wife are tied onto a wooden pole, waiting to be killed, just as hundreds of years ago, the evil in charge of the island and win against the justice. Then the drums for the execution start, and the rhythm starts to sound increasingly familiar to Zinga. It’s the Song of Freedom, the secret song passed on by each king of the island. He can’t help but start singing the Song and sings so well that the crowds turn astonishment to appreciation and admiration. He’s the king!! Someone from the crowd shouts out and the people eventually believe he is the king and are willing to listen to him. Zinga wins against the witch doctor at last and achieves his dream. He goes back to America and frequently brings back medicine and technology of all kinds, helping his people to be civilized and educated. At the end of the movie, Zinga picks up his career as a singer again and performs the song he sang a long time ago, \"Lonely Road\" on a stage decorated as his little island, referring to his achieving his dream and the help he brought to his people, leading them to a better life.',\n",

Due to the dam's construction, the citizens of Kitanosawa were forced into a new town and their old homes were drowned by the dam. Since Asakura's trip to celebrate the anniversary of the dam is canceled by the bombing, Conan speculates information on the bomber could be found in Kitanosawa and plans a trip there. Conan, the Detective Boys, Ran Mori, Kogoro Mori, and Sonoko Suzuki travel to Kitanosawa and enjoy the day playing. They are introduced to a group of locals; their names are Keisuke Yamao, Mizuki Toono, Fuyumi Tachihara, Takehiki Mutou, and Shougo Hikawa. The group reveals they were all childhood friends and were part of the group which relocated to the new village. They also reveal its their first gathering in eight years since Yamao was in prison for killing Toono's sister, Natsuki Toono, in a hit and run. The next day, Tachihara's son, Touma Tachihara, awakens from his eight year coma with no memory of his accident. Later that day, Hikawa is found dead in a field. Originally, it was assumed to be suicide since only Hikawa's footprints were found in the snow. Conan reveals Hikawa was killed by an electroshock weapon. The culprit then waited for it to snow and walked away backwards to suggest Hikawa was alone. During a diamond dust caused by the sunrise, Touma experiences a flashback on the day of the accident. Conan investigates Hikawa's belongings and finds a newspaper clipping detailing a jewelry store was robbed the day before the hit and run. A cell site is destroyed by bombs leading Conan to hypothesis who the culprit possibly is. Meanwhile, the Detective Boys and Touma are hunted down by a sniper. Conan intervenes and leads them to safety. Taking a route towards the dam, Conan explains Yamao is the culprit. Yamao robbed the jewelry store in a distant town and drives back to Kitanosawa. On the way, he runs over Natsuki, a scene which Touma notices. Touma is then kidnapped by Yamao and sees the diamonds, explaining why the diamond dust startled his memories. Touma escapes but falls down a cliff leading to his coma. Yamao then buries the jewels in a property in Kitanosawa and turns himself over to the authorities for Natsuki's death. Unexpectedly, the dam project forced the town of Kitanosawa underwater. As a result, Yamao decides to bomb the dam to search old-Kitanosawa for the diamonds. In order to have enough time to perform the search, he had to cancel the Governor's trip and destroy the cell site to prevent the outside world from learning off the dam's destruction. Upon arriving at the dam, Conan is pursued by Yamao who intends to kill him. Yamao is then shot and incapacitated by Toono. Touma regains his memories of the accident upon seeing Toono and reveals he saw Toono push Natsuki off into the road. Toona professes she was the sniper attempting to kill Touma and that the death of her sister was an accident. Yamao, having set off the bombs in the dam forces them to flee. Conan diverges from the group intending to start an avalanche by creating grooves in a steep mountain with his motorized snowboard to divert the flow away from Kitanosawa. He is successful but his motor short-circuits causing him to be caught in the avalanche. He is eventually free when Ran calls Shinichi's cellphone causing him to regain consciousness to alert the others of his position.\",\n",

              " '{{plot}} While Earl and Val became wealthy with their discovery of the Graboids, Earl lost most of his fortune. Earl is approached by two men, Grady Hoover and Señor Ortega. Ortega knows that Earl and Val dealt with the Graboids previously. He informs Earl that there are more of them killing workers at the Petromaya Oil Field; he needs help to dispose of them. Earl refuses, horrified at the prospect that there are more of the creatures that almost killed him. Grady tells him that Ortega will pay him $50,000 for each graboid. Earl agrees to eliminate the Graboids, and Grady accompanies him. On their way to the Petromaya Oil Field, Earl and Grady are introduced to Pedro, the company\\'s chief engineer and Kate Reilly, a geologist. Ortega brings Earl and Grady a few cases of dynamite and an CAR-15. A man named Julio introduces a seismic monitor that will show Grady and Earl where the Graboids are. Grady builds a chain with a few empty aluminum cans attached to it to attract the Graboids. Earl and Grady kill 16 Graboids using dynamite strapped to remote-control toy cars. Another Graboid snags the chain Grady hooked to the back of the truck. The Graboid begins dragging them across the field. When the Graboid snaps the chain Earl sees more Graboids approaching on the seismic monitor. Earl calls up Burt Gummer, an old friend of his who helped him take down the Graboids with Val. Burt comes in with an army truck filled with explosives and weapons. The group splits up to kill more of the Graboids. Earl and Grady see another Graboid on the seismograph. Oddly, the Graboid is moving away from them, so Earl and Grady investigate. Upon reaching the top of a hill, the Graboid surfaces. In a panic Earl backs his truck down the side of the hill and into a pile of rocks, breaking an axle. They see the Graboid has not moved. Earl and Grady wait for Pedro to bring the Graboid back to the refinery. The Graboid makes loud, painful noises, and Grady and Earl see some of the insides of the Graboid are missing, leading Earl to believe that something emerged from it. While Earl tries contacting Kate over the radio, he notices that the radio\\'s transmitter has been damaged, then he and Grady hear another Graboid making a noise just like that of the one they encountered earlier. Grady sees Pedro\\'s truck coming up the road only to stop. When Earl and Grady walk to the truck, they see it is damaged and all that is left of Pedro are his severed arms. Earl decides to call for help by hiking to a nearby radio tower. Burt has become worried that his monitor is showing no Graboids and begins returning to the refinery. When Grady and Earl reach the radio tower they find it has been damaged. Earl spots a car near a small bar that Grady tries hotwiring. The two hear a strange noise coming from the bar, then see a creature resembling a smaller two-legged Graboid, dubbed a \"Shrieker\", emerge from the bar. Grady and Earl kill it, but three more Shriekers come for them. They drive the car back to the refinery. As Burt is trying to get back he is ambushed by Shriekers. Kate, unable to contact anyone, grows worried. Julio agrees to find them. As he is about to leave a Shrieker devours him. Grady and Earl kill the Shrieker that killed Julio and reunite with Kate. As they are about to leave another Shrieker appears and begins damaging their car\\'s engine, but Earl kills it. Burt arrives with his truck damaged from the Shriekers that attacked him. He shows them a Shrieker he caught alive, unaware that another Shrieker has stowed away underneath his truck. The four discover that the Shrieker hunts by using a heat sensor on top of its head, explaining why the Shriekers attacked the cars and the radio tower. When it consumes a piece of food it creates another Shrieker. While enjoying this spectacle, Kate, Earl, Grady and Burt are ambushed by Shriekers. The group plans to drive off with Julio\\'s car, but another Shrieker is blocking their path. Burt uses his .50 BMG rifle to kill it, but the bullet goes through the Shrieker and damages the engine block of Julio\\'s car. More Shriekers trap Grady, Earl and Kate on top of an oil tower and Burt in the bucket of a tractor. The Shriekers start jumping onto each other\\'s backs to reach Grady, Earl and Kate. Burt makes the Shriekers chase him into the storage compartment where his truck is. He is able to lock a door and close a garage, trapping them. However, this proves to be problematic as the garage is filled with food and allows the Shrikers to reproduce at a rapid rate. Earl sprays himself with a fire extinguisher to make him cold so that the Shriekers will not see him, so that he can reach Burt\\'s bombs. As he is walking the frost from his body dissolves and the Shriekers see Earl in Burt\\'s truck. Earl sets off a timed charge and throws it in the back of Burt\\'s truck. Grady, Burt and Kate pull him out with a hose, and the four run from the refinery. The bomb detonates the explosives in Burt\\'s truck and destroys the refinery, killing the Shriekers. Grady tells Earl that the Petromaya corporation owes them for 28 worms they killed. As they walk towards the remains of the refinery, Earl suggests they charge the corporation for the Shriekers they killed. When Grady says that they can open up their own Monster World, Earl says, \"No way.\", but Grady says, \"Oh, C\\'mon, Earl. This could be like your big third chance\".',\n",

Donovan breaks up the fight and advises Tony to talk with a “psychologist” that works at the local aircraft plant, Dr. Alfred Brandon , a practitioner of hypnotherapy. Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene  - as well as his widowed father  - show concern about his violent behavior. Later, at a Halloween party at “the Haunted House” – an old house that several of the teenagers hang out at – Tony attacks his friend Vic  after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends’ faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon. On Tony’s first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist’s couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he’s developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future mankind has is to 'hurl him back to his primitive state.' Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner , protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a werewolf. That night, after a small party at the haunted house, Tony drives Arlene home; and one of their buddies, Frank , is attacked and killed as he is walking home through the woods. While Donovan and Police Chief Baker  review photographs of the victim and await an autopsy, Pepi , the police station's janitor, persuades officer Chris Stanley  to let him see the photos. Pepi, a native of the Carpathian Mountains, where werewolves, “human beings possessed by wolves” are common, immediately recognizes the marks on Frank's body, much to the disbelief of Chris, who balks at the idea of a werewolf.

Miss Ferguson tells Tony that she is pleased with him; Brandon has given him a positive report regarding his behavior; and that she intends to recommend Tony for entry into State College. As Tony leaves the principal's office happy with the good news, he passes the gymnasium where Theresa  is practicing by herself. A school bell behind his head suddenly rings, triggering his transformation into a werewolf, and he attacks and kills Theresa.

A local reporter, Doyle , interviews Tony's father as well as Arlene and her parents, in the hope of locating Tony and getting a scoop. Baker and Donovan attempt to trap Tony in the woods where they think he may be hiding. Still in the form of a werewolf, Tony watches as the dragnet looks for him, but is surprised by a dog and ends up killing it. In the morning, Tony awakens and sees he has reverted to his normal appearance and walks into the town. After phoning Arlene , Tony heads to Brandon's office and begs for his help. Brandon wants to witness Tony's transformation, and capture it on film in order to advance himself in the scientific community. Brandon tells Tony he will help him and after telling him to lie on the couch, and injects him with the serum again. Immediately following the transformation, a nearby ringing telephone triggers Tony's instincts and he leaps up and kills both Brandon and Wagner, breaking open the film camera in the process, ruining the film. Alerted that Tony has been seen nearby, Donovan and Chris break in and are forced to shoot several times as Tony advances toward them.

              " '{{Plot}}  The cartoon begins with Spike sleeping beside his son Tyke. When Tyke suddenly wakes up, Spike comforts him back to sleep again. Just then, Tom and Jerry enter the scene. Tom runs through a door and into some spades, rakes and hoes, as Jerry hides among Spike and Tyke. To find Jerry, Tom lifts Tyke up to look underneath the little bulldog. Spike sees Tom manhandling his son, runs onscreen up to Tom and yells out \"Hey, you! That\\'s my boy you got in your hand!\" Tom realizes that he has Tyke in his hands and smiles nervously, attempting to run off, but Spike grabs Tom by the whiskers and issues him an ultimatum: \"Listen, pussy cat. If I catch you bothering my boy again, I\\'ll tear you apart. Now beat it!\" Tom gets the message, and runs off in the opposite direction hitting everything - a tree a fountain,etc. He finally makes it and hides in a trash can. Jerry emerges from behind Tyke and walks off casually until Tom comes running back. Jerry takes cover by diving into a sleeping Spike\\'s mouth...at least, that\\'s what Tom is led to believe. Tom places his hand carefully in Spike\\'s mouth while the dog is sleeping. It turns out that Jerry was hiding between Spike\\'s arms. He puts his hands on the bottom of Spike\\'s jaw and slams the bulldog\\'s jaws shut with Tom\\'s hand still in Spike\\'s mouth. He yelps in pain and Spike wakes up. Tom struggles to get his hand out of Spike\\'s mouth. Eventually, he does, pulling out Spike\\'s teeth. Tom looks nervously and uses Spike\\'s teeth as castanets while doing a Flamenco dance out of the scene and placing them on a pail.  In the next scene, Tom spies Jerry sleeping next to Tyke. Hiding behind Tyke\\'s kennel, he reaches out for Jerry. Jerry, knowing that Tom is about to grab him, moves Tyke\\'s tail into Tom\\'s grip, so that Tom ends up grabbing Tyke. After running off with the little pup, moments later, Tom realizes his mistake. He turns around to see a sleeping Spike feeling for Tyke. Tom rushes back into Tyke\\'s place, taking on the role of Tyke so Spike doesn\\'t know that he took Tyke. Jerry then lifts up Tyke\\'s kennel and slams it on Tom\\'s tail. Tom yells in pain, and Spike picks him up and pats him on the back. \"There, there, son. Ain\\'t no cat gonna hoot you, no sir\" not realizing that he is holding Tom. Just then, Tyke walks back onto the scene and whimpers. Spike looks at Tom suspiciously, realizing that he is not his son at all. So Tom whimpers in the same manner as Tyke. Then Tyke yaps, which Tom also does. Finally, Tyke growls and woofs, to which Tom growls, but accidentally meows he puts his paw over his mouth hoping Spike didn\\'t notice . The game is over, and Spike finally realizes, but Tom bites him on the nose and runs off. Tom sets a rake, if Spike chases him, he will be hit at the trap. But, Spike is running forward. Knowing that he lost his opponent, Tom goes back, but he is hit in the rake. In the next scene, a piece of steak being transported across a washing line, and the movement is controlled by Tom. The steak stops moving, directly above Spike\\'s nose , that he can smell it. Tom moves the steak back towards him, and Spike, still sleeping, is entranced by the smell of the steak, following it, all the while with his eyes closed. Jerry is wise to what\\'s going on and tries to stop the hypnotized Spike. He drags him by the tail, but ends up getting his own head caught in a tap. Then he knocks on Spike\\'s eyelids and opens his eyelid, but the bulldog does not respond. Finally, Jerry ends up being stomped flat. Tom lures Spike into a garden shed and barricades the door so that Spike can\\'t get out. He snickers evilly, and chases Jerry. Which he ended in a barrel. Tom then catches Jerry, trapping him inside an upturned barrel. However, without Tom noticing, Jerry escapes through the side of the barrel and puts Tyke under the barrel instead. Spike breaks through the shed door and rushes up to Tom angrily, demanding \"Where\\'s my boy?!\" Tom responds as if to say \"I don\\'t know\". \"If he\\'s under that barrel, I\\'ll skin ya alive!\" Spike warns. Tom confidently attempts to lift up the barrel, until he hears a whistle, and looks to his side to see Jerry lying on a nearby fence. Realising he\\'s in trouble, Tom gulps in great panic. \"Come on, lift it up!\" Spike yells. Tom struggles to do so, so Spike lifts up the barrel for him, and behold, Tyke is lying underneath it wagging his tail at his father. Tom runs off but before he can escape, the bulldog corners him and skins him alive. The cat is screaming in pain as he is skinned alive. In the final scene, Tom has literally been skinned alive, and is wearing a barrel to cover his lack of fur tapping his hand on a bat and peeking out in a hole in the fence. Tom\\'s fur is being used as a snug rug by a sleeping Spike, Tyke and Jerry, who hangs a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign over Spike\\'s ear and snuggles up between the father and son and sleeps.',\n",

Christian\\'s twin sister, Linda, recently committed suicide at the hotel. Before the celebration dinner, Helene finds Linda\\'s suicide note, but hides it after becoming upset by the contents . Michael fights with his wife, whom he earlier abandoned on the roadside with their three children, and then has sex with her. Michael later is pulled aside by a waitress whom he had an affair with  and then beats her when she disparages Helge. Later, during dinner, Christian makes a speech to the family in which he accuses his father Helge of sexually abusing him and his late sister Linda. Helge\\'s family and friends initially dismiss the accusations as absurd, a joke, or a figment of Christian\\'s imagination. In a private conversation in the pantry, a seemingly baffled Helge asks Christian about his motivations for slandering him, and a Christian appears to recant from his accusation. However, Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim , a childhood friend who knows about the abuse. Christian then stands up and continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda\\'s death. Helge speaks to Christian alone and threateningly offers to announce in a toast Christian\\'s troubled personal history, impotence with women and his perhaps inappropriately close relationship with his late sister, Linda. Christian says nothing in response to the threat. Further exacerbating the tensions of the day, Helene\\'s black boyfriend Gbatokai  shows up, enraging the racist Michael who later leads most of the partygoers in singing the Danish song Jeg har set en rigtig negermand in a racist way to offend him. During a toast, Else makes a series of back-handed compliments towards her children, accusing Christian of having an overactive imagination as a child and asking him to apologize for his earlier accusation. Christian responds by accusing her of interrupting Helge during one of the rapes, yet not interfering with the incident, and calling her a \"cunt\". Michael and two other guests violently eject Christian from the hotel. When Christian walks back in, they beat Christian and tie him to a tree in the nearby woods.  Christian\\'s accusations are confirmed when Helene, apparently finally worn down by guilt, reads Linda\\'s suicide note aloud to the assembled guests. Linda\\'s note states that she decided to kill herself after feeling overwhelmed by dreams in which her father was molesting her again. In a fit of anger, Helge admits to the abuse in front of all the guests by saying that it was all Christian was good for. He then leaves the dining room with the guests stunned.

Believing Vijay to be helping the man, they kidnap his wife and demand the surrender of the man, but Vijay and the man team up to rescue Vijay’s wife which makes Vijay pledge to help the man in his quest. The man then goes to talk to the singer, but is soon recognised and is shot at. Shanti helps him escape and gives him a phone number to contact but is seriously wounded. He contacts the number and barely escapes another attempt on his life but manages to meet the person Shanti referred who happens to be the police commissioner. He finally learns of his true identity. His name is Vetri and that he was a happily married to Lalitha , a police officer who teamed up with the commissioner to bring down a notorious hitman Zinda . Unable to find any information about Zinda’s whereabouts, they devise a plan to make Vetri go undercover and make him a bigger and more dangerous hitman than Zinda, hoping Zinda would get in touch with his fiercest competitor. The plan works and soon Zinda and Vetri become friends. But soon, Zinda learns about an undercover police officer in his gang through a spy and kidnap Lalitha to oust the spy. Vetri breaks his cover to protect Lalitha, but she is shot and killed in the shooting that ensues and Vetri is chased  but escapes barely. Vetri puts the pieces back together and uncovers a plot by Zinda to assassinate a very popular priest, when he went to visit the singer. Vijay and Vetri thwart the plot but Zinda still manages to escape. In order to avenge this Zinda kidnaps both Vijay's and Vetri's wives and sends them a photographic evidence of the kidnap. But Vetri and Vijay soon find the location with the background signboard in the photo and rescue their wives and arrest Zinda. Awaiting Zinda's presence in the courtroom for his trial, they are surprised to see an unknown man being presented in the trial as Zinda. This makes them think that the commissioner may be the spy who swapped Zinda out and rushes to his house to confront him, but finds him murdered in the arms of his crying wife. Suspicions still exist and Vetri and Vijay find that the real spy is the commissioner's wife and they confront her. She shows them a lot of cash and asks them to let her go. Vijay sees this and shoots and kill Vetri for the money and asks her to give him the money and leave. Believing that Vetri is finally dead, she rushes back to Zinda. But Vetri is alive and this was a plan to make her lead them to Zinda's location. Vetri and Vijay follow her to a ship docked on the port and go in to arrest Zinda. Zinda and his men are soon overpowered by the two man fighting machine, but before he dies he arms a bomb in the ship. Vetri and Vijay collaborate once again to disarm the bomb.\",\n",
              " 'The main characters are Cochise ([[Jeff Chandler  and Tom Jeffords . The film is based on the actions of these historical figures, but tells their story in dramatized form. As the movie begins, Jeffords comes upon a wounded Indian, a 14-year-old Apache boy dying from buckshot wounds in his back. Jeffords gives the boy water and heals his wounds. The boy\\'s tribesmen appear and are at first hostile, but due to Jeffords\\' treatment of the boy decide to let him go free. However a group of gold prospectors are spotted and Jeffords is gagged, tied to a tree and made to watch as the Apaches attack the prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors then let him go but warn him not to enter Apache territory again. When Jeffords returns to Tucson he encounters a prospector who escaped the ambush. When he corrects the man\\'s exaggerated account of the attack, another man, Ben Slade Will Geer asks how he knows what happened. Tom describes how he found the boy and the following events. Slade is incredulous and doesn\\'t see why Jeffords didn\\'t kill the boy. Jeffords is later asked to scout for the army but refuses. Jeffords learns Apache, how to make and read smoke signals and plans to go to Cochise\\'s stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt Arthur Hunnicut who is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. The Apaches have killed many couriers and halted the delivery of mail for years. Jeffords enters the Apache stronghold with the aid of smoke signals and begins a parley with Cochise, comparing the mail service to smoke signals. Cochise agrees to let the couriers through. Tom meets a young Apache girl, Sonseeahray Debra Paget and begins to fall in love. The Apaches stay true to their word and the mail riders are able to ride to Tucson. However Cochise did not agree to full peace and an army wagon train is massacred. When the survivors arrive in town Jeffords is almost lynched as a traitor before he is saved by General Oliver Howard who recruits Tom to negotiate peace with Cochise. Howard says that his troops call him \"Bible-reading Howard\". On questioning by Jeffords about the biblical implications for the Indians, Howard condemns racism, saying that the Bible \"says nothing about pigmentation of the skin.\" Jeffords tells him to read the Bible for him, \"because I like the way you read it.\" Jeffords manages to broker peace with Cochise but the Apaches splinter, a group led by Geronimo  oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. Tom accompanies the first stagecoach to leave Tucson during the \\'testing time\\' of three months set out by Cochise. Geronimo and his renegades ambush the coach as it stops at a river. Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved. Tom and Sonseeahray marry and have several days of tranquility. One day when Jeffords is getting an archery lesson from Cochise Ben Slade\\'s son arrives, guarded by two Apaches. He spins a story about his horses being stolen by Cochise\\'s Apaches, he denies this but Jeffords asks him to go along with the boy to prove Slade, a famous hater of the Apaches, wrong. Slade and a gang of men from Tucson ambush Cochise, Tom and Sonseeahray. Jeffords tells Cochise to run while he attempts to hold off the men. Tom is wounded and knocked unconscious and Sonseeahray is killed. Cochise dispatches several of the men including both of the Slades, and goes to gather his warriors. The remaining men from Tucson head for Mexico as the army will now surely hunt them down as criminals. Jeffords regains consciousness as Cochise returns and prevents Tom from killing one of the wounded men. He still backs the peace treaty. Howard and the army pay their respects at the Apache camp, and assure Jeffords that Sonseeahray\\'s death will not be in vain. Jeffords leaves to wander the West on his own with the assertion that \\'the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace\\' and \\'from that day on wherever I went - in the cities, among the Apaches, in the mountains - I always remembered my wife was with me\\'.',\n",

Jerry emerges from a mouse hole which has a Hollywood Bowl-like exterior. Jerry rushes to the podium to conduct the orchestra alongside Tom. Tom notices Jerry and attempts to flatten him with his baton, until he sees Jerry continuing to conduct the music, from Tom\\'s baton. Tom stuffs him into his suit and continues to conduct the orchestra, but Jerry pops out from both of Tom\\'s sleeves, then his dickie to conduct further. Tom grabs him and catapults Jerry from his baton, and Jerry lands safely on a harp, but as his eyes are closed while conducting, he doesn\\'t realise where he is at first. When he does open his eyes, he glances angrily at Tom. He offers to dance the Du und du with Tom, and the cat dances innocently with the mouse, until Jerry sends Tom spinning into a cello. Tom gets his revenge on Jerry by offering him a chance to dance. He pummels and wallops Jerry around the stage and hurls him into a tuba, where he is \"squirted\" by the blowing of one of the orchestra members into the instrument. The attempts of both cat and mouse to get one up on each other continues, with Tom using his baton as a snooker cue to pot Jerry off the podium. When Jerry pleads and begs Tom to let him conduct the orchestra, Tom uses Jerry\\'s baton as a toothpick and throws it away. Jerry retaliates by snapping Tom\\'s baton in half and then throwing that away, only for Tom to produce a spare baton from his pocket. He sticks his tongue at Jerry and continues to conduct. Jerry, fed up, hammers some wheels onto the podium and pushes the podium  out of the amphitheatre. Tom, unaware of what is going on, continues to conduct, as the podium travels out of town and into the road, where he is promptly flattened by a passing bus. By now, Tom is furious. He returns, with his suit ripped and his eyes blackened, and grabs Jerry by the coat-tails, and dangles him between two cymbals, which are bashed together, flattening Jerry. A flat and almost transparent Jerry floats down to the floor and pops back to his full size and structure. Enraged and deciding to sabotage the concert, Jerry grabs a saw and starts sawing underneath the floor of the orchestra, causing the feline members of the orchestra to suddenly disappear under the floor. Jerry disposes of the orchestra members, one by one, until only Tom is left to play all of the instruments while Jerry conducts and the concert ends. And of course, Jerry takes all applause and credit for himself, then he points to the \"One-Man Orchestra\" Tom, who is now very tired. Then Tom stands up, bows down ,and then falls down like rest of the feline orchestra.',\n",

              " 'A fifty-year war between the Eastern Federation and Europa ends, with the Federation taking control of the Eurasian continent. A resistance movement rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the environment. Dr. Azuma presents his discovery of Neo Cells, human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue. The Neo Cells are only found in the genome of \"a primitive ethnic group.\" He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori. A photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya\\'s  engagement to Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a booby trap. Azuma invites Luna\\'s father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma\\'s cell research makes Kozuki\\'s armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya\\'s ghost. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma\\'s lab. Tetsuya\\'s ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack. Azuma carries Tetsuya\\'s body into his lab. Tetsuya is resurrected, but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki\\'s residence. Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor. The Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves \"Neo-Sapiens,\" they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity. Kozuki\\'s residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is contaminated, and Luna falls ill. Tetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren\\'t terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government\\'s discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named \"Casshern\"-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-sapien is injured. A coup d’état takes place and General Kamijo\\'s son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered \"original humans\" of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts\\' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins. Burai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo\\'s son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she\\'s apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area. In the finale, the General\\'s son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai\\'s family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father. The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other. Luna rips out Tetsuya\\'s containment suit and a pillar of light fires into space. It ends with a monologue by Tetsuya while the screen alternates between the pillar of light making its way through space & crashing down onto another planet and flashbacks of happier times for the characters. The film ends with home footage of the characters in happier times.',\n",

Don tries to change her mind and it looks as if he has succeeded , until Don\\'s best friend, Johnny , turns up. Nadine reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and it becomes obvious that Nadine is attracted to Johnny. Angry, Don leaves to drown his sorrows at a bar. Johnny follows him and tries to persuade him to talk to Nadine, but to no avail; Don brags that he does not need Nadine and that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. After Johnny leaves, he picks out one of the girls dancing on the stage, Hannah Brown , and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. Hannah then performs a duet, singing a musical number with a member of the band  on trombone, \"I Want to Go Back to Michigan.\" The next morning, Don tries to turn Hannah into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an \"exotic\" stage name, \"Juanita.\" However, Hannah makes several mistakes at their first performance and the show is a fiasco. Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings \"A Fella With An Umbrella\" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. At the rehearsal, Don, realizing his mistake, decides to start over from scratch by creating routines more suited to Hannah\\'s personality. Hannah sings \"I Love A Piano\" and she works out a dance routine with Don that proves much more successful than their earlier performance. The duo, now known as \"Hannah & Hewes\", are shown to be performing \"Snookie-Ookums\", \"The Ragtime Violin\", and \"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam\\'\" in a montage of their performances. At an audition for Ziegfeld Follies, where they perform \"Midnight Choo-Choo\", they meet Nadine who is starring in the show. Hannah realizes that Nadine was Don\\'s former dancing partner and demands to know if they were in love. Don hesitates and Hannah runs out of the rehearsal where she encounters Johnny. Later, Don meets Hannah back at the hotel and reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that Hannah and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny soon arrives and takes Hannah out for dinner at which, after a comical routine by the waiter, Johnny reveals that he has fallen in love with Hannah. While Hannah does like Johnny, she admits she is actually in love with Don; she also admits to deliberately making mistakes when they rehearse so she can be with him longer. She and Johnny continue to have a close friendship. Meanwhile, Nadine\\'s show opens and Don goes to see it . He is the only member of the audience who seems unimpressed. Later on, Don goes to see Hannah and tell her that they will be starring in another show and invites her to dinner to celebrate. Hannah goes to dinner at Don\\'s, only to have him suggest a dance rehearsal. She is immediately upset and turns to walk out, telling him that he\\'s \"nothing but a pair of dancing shoes\" and that he doesn\\'t see her as a woman, but as a dancing aid. Hannah is particularly annoyed that Don doesn\\'t notice her new clothes and all the effort she has made for him. She tries to leave, but Don stops her and kisses her. Hannah then plays the piano and sings \"It Only Happens When I Dance With You,\" after which Don realizes he is in love with Hannah and they embrace. The couple take part in a variety show, with a solo by Don  and then comes the most famous musical number in the film , in which Don and Hannah play a pair of street urchins with vivid imaginations. Don and Hannah go out to celebrate after the show and end up watching Nadine perform. Nadine is mad with jealousy when the audience gives Don and Hannah a round of applause as they come in. Nadine is the star dancer in \"The Girl On The Magazine Cover.\" The song features an ingenious stage act, in which women appear against backdrops that look like the covers of contemporary magazines. Nadine herself appears on the cover of Harper\\'s Bazaar. Afterwards, she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her for old times\\' sake, as she tries to win Don back - \"It Only Happens When I Dance With You .\" When Don reluctantly agrees, Hannah becomes upset and runs out. She ends up at the bar where she and Don first met. There she pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender . Later, when Hannah returns to her apartment, she finds Don waiting for her. Don tries to explain that he was forced to dance with Nadine, but Hannah thinks Don used her to make Nadine jealous and win her back. Don tells Hannah he\\'ll wait all night for her to forgive him, but just before Hannah opens the door, Don is kicked out of her building by the house detective. The next morning Hannah is telling Johnny about her and Don\\'s misunderstanding. Johnny says if he loved someone he would let her know it, implying that Hannah should forget the argument and be with Don. Hannah realizes that Johnny is right and goes to meet Don for their date for the Easter Parade. Meanwhile, Don has been receiving various gifts at his apartment that morning, such as a rabbit and a new top hat, unaware that they\\'re from Hannah. She arrives unexpectedly at his house, as if the argument never happened. Don is a little confused by this turn of events, but decides to go out with Hannah anyway. As they walk in the Easter parade, photographers, echoing a scene with Nadine from the beginning of the film, take their pictures and Don proposes to Hannah ([[Easter Parade .',\n",

He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to get married to him as soon as possible but Shankar has bigger things to worry about. Shankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter by simply twisting his hand for a few seconds. The animosity is raised a few notches when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men to pulp. Weapons are no use against Shankar, who can jump 10 feet in the air and fell the 250 pound goons with a single punch.

To no one's surprise, Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale. After this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. In the iconic fight that follows, cots are shown hanging from the roof at several heights, and Shankar piledrives goons into them one by one, while prostitutes swing on the cots and stare in awe and amazement. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child, born from Haseena. While Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is an impotent & it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy & made him violently rape Shankar's sister.

              " 'The film begins with a U.S. Army fort destroyed and burned as an U.S. Army Cavalry patrol combs the ruins for survivors, but everyone is dead. The commander of the cavalry patrol is dictating a report to his clerk in the office of the fort\\'s commander. Held prisoner in the former commander\\'s office is the Arapahoe war chief, Hanu, who led the raid. He will say very little. And all the searchers can find is a single grave and a Colt pistol left behind by a gunman Hanu remembers as a \"quiet, lonely man...\" After finding the Arapahoes starving, a wandering gunman named Chuka  gives them the last of his food. \"For the Children\", he says. His gift impresses Hanu. Later, Chuka encounters a stagecoach with Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz  and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez . The Arapahoes arrive, led by Hanu. Everyone is prepared for death, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and simply rides on. Later, Chuka finds himself stranded in an isolated U.S. Army fort with the coach and passengers. The fort\\'s second-in-comomand. Major Benson, asks the stage driver about the \"saddle tramp\" hanging around the stable and is told not to let him hear Benson calling him that, warning him: \"That, Major, is a hired gun. He\\'s called Chuka and he is fast. Awful fast.\" The fort\\'s commander, Colonel Stuart Valois , is worried that the Arapahoes may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent  to reconnoiter, but his horse returns without him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that nearly everyone in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father\\'s ranch, he was beaten and run off and she dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice for being drunk when his command was attacked. His second in command, Major Benson  is a card cheat, while Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of the charge of treason. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach  is a first-rate soldier; he had served with then British Captain Valois in the Sudan and owes his life to Valois. Hansbach tells Chuka that when Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois\\'s command in the Sudan he blundered and was captured by the enemy. Valois\\'s and his unit raided the enemy camp and rescued Hansbach from horrible torture and certain death. But Valois himself is captured by the enemy during this raid and is left behind when his unit is forced to withdraw during the enemy\\'s counter-attack. Valois is horribly tortured by the enemy and it is implied that they castrated him during the torturing. Valois\\'s unit eventually rescues him but he is scarred physically and psychologically by the events. Hansbach tells Chuka because of this he will always serve under Valois\\'s command and never question his courage. Chuka tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to save her niece, the fort is under siege. Chuka agrees  to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. Chuka then pleads with Valois to abandon the fort, since Hanu , the Arapahoe leader, only wants the food supplies in the fort, but Valois is determined to find out if he really is a coward or not, even though he is hopelessly outnumbered. He has to put down an attempted mutiny, killing the ringleader Spivey ([[Michael Cole . That night, as they wait for the impending attack, Senora Kleitz goes to Chuka, and they make love. The next day, the Indians attack. Senora Kleitz is killed early on, as is Valois; with his last words, the colonel mourns the fact that he was struck down too soon, never to learn if he was a coward. With nearly everyone else dead and himself seriously wounded, Chuka hides with Helena Chavez. The victorious Arapahoes take the supplies and leave. As they pass, Chuka has his pistol at Helena\\'s head. ready to kill her to keep her from the Indians. But Hanu again recognizes him and rides on, letting them both live. The debt he owes this man is now paid in full. We return to the present where the commander of the cavalry relief column is finishing his report. He speaks about the grave and the gun and that he will not disturb the grave. Of Chuka - and Helena - there is no sign, but the inference is that the gunman has put away his past and taken Helena away, paying his debt to Kleitz.',\n",

He intends to ride out, even if dead. King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. The morning after El Cid dies, his body is secured upon his horse and sent out at the head of his army with King Alfonso and Emir Al-Mu\\'tamin on either side of his horse.

              " 'The film begins in Seattle. Seattle police officers Madam Yeung Lai-ching , Donnie Yen, and their Caucasian partner Peter Woods tail a group of Chinese cocaine dealers through a mall. Madam Yeung and Peter tail them to a seaport that night, where a shipment has just arrived from Hong Kong. Chinese workmen load crates into the drug dealers\\' truck. Madam Yeung, in defiance of Peter, acrobatically infiltrates the docks and enters the truck, but is caught by one of the workmen, Luk Wan-ting . She convinces him that she\\'s a stowaway illegal immigrant from Hong Kong, and he takes her to his nearby attic apartment, where he gives her some money to help her, as he and his brother too were illegal immigrants for seven years. He has just obtained legal ID cards for both of them. She tries to stealthily check in with Peter, who is tailing the cocaine dealers to an unknown location, but Luk grows suspicious and catches her. Just then Luk\\'s brother Ming  crashes in through a skylight, pursued by six armed thugs to whom he owes $20,000 due to his gambling addiction. Luk attacks the thugs to save Ming, revealing that he has some martial arts skill. Madam Yeung joins the fight against the thugs. Together they drive the thugs away. She returns Luk\\'s money and leaves. The next morning, Madam Yeung realizes that one of the Chinese cocaine dealers is following her. She ambushes him, and they fight. He has some martial arts skill, but not as much as her. After a minute he gives up and flees by jumping off a hundred-foot tower into the harbor. Meanwhile, Donnie tails one of the cocaine dealers to a restaurant, where his friend Captain Michael Wong happens to be having breakfast with a girl. He comes over to say hi to Donnie, inadvertently obscuring Donnie\\'s view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside in search of the criminal, but are ambushed by a couple martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them. Elsewhere, Peter has tailed the cocaine dealers to a mining corporation warehouse on the docks, where they sell cocaine to a Caucasian gang. Peter attempts to arrest them all, revealing that the Caucasians\\' leader is a CIA officer named Mr. Robinson, which the Hong Kong dealers didn\\'t know. He photographs Mr. Robinson in the act of the cocaine deal. Mr. Robinson draws a concealed shotgun and shoots Peter in the torso, and then he and his men shoot all the Chinese dealers dead . They try to retrieve the camera, but Peter is still alive, and he flees the warehouse even as Mr. Robinson shoots him again. Outside, he crashes into Luk, hands him his gun and the negative of the photo, and tells him to give it to the police. Then Mr. Robinson and his men catch up and shoot him dead. They open fire at Luk too, but Luk flees behind a shed and accidentally drops the negative into the ocean. Mr. Robinson and his men continue to pursue Luk and shoot at him, but Luk is rescued at the last moment by the arrival of the Seattle police. Mr. Robinson and his men jump into their car and escape. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and the other officers drive up and find their partner\\'s corpse and Luk with a gun. They arrest Luk. At the Seattle police station, Donnie interrogates Luk, thinking he was a member of the Hong Kong gang and convinced that he hid the negative somewhere, while Luk proclaims his innocence. Donnie\\'s interrogation is interrupted by a higher ranking officer, and Donnie leaves the interrogation room. The new officer threatens Luk to give him the negative, and brutally beats him with a baton when he claims he doesn\\'t know where it is. Luk defends himself and knocks out the corrupt officer, then puts on his uniform and sneaks out of the police station. Luk goes to Ming\\'s apartment, and Ming gives up his ID card, which Luk worked for seven years to get him, to get $3000 for a seat on a ship to take Luk back to Hong Kong that night. It is revealed that Luk is skilled at repairing Ming\\'s TV antenna. Just then a couple of gunmen enter the apartment in search of Luk. Ming sacrifices his life to save Luk, while Luk keeps trying to save Ming until he dies, then finally flees. Just as Luk reaches the apartment complex\\'s exit, Madam Yeung and Donnie pull up outside, having come to arrest him. Luk runs back in. Madam Yeung and Donnie split up to search the apartment complex. Donnie sees Luk and chases him onto the rooftop, where Luk ambushes him, and they fight. Donnie almost immediately gets the advantage and beats up Luk, who flees, jumping from rooftops with Donnie in hot pursuit. Luk jumps onto a Budget truck and rides it away. Donnie, still convinced that Luk is a cocaine dealer, draws his gun and takes aim, but Madam Yeung appears and knocks it away to save the potentially innocent Luk, who escapes. Back at the Seattle police station, Donnie\\'s superior orders him off the case because he has no faith in him, and replaces him with Michael. Donnie requests to stay on the case as Michael\\'s partner, and Michael convinces their superior to allow it. That night, Luk goes to board the ship to Hong Kong. He has to sell his ID card as well to buy passage. Donnie gets information that Luk escaped to Hong Kong on that ship, and he, Michael, and Madam Yeung fly to Hong Kong, arriving before the ship. When the ship reaches port, the Hong Kong police board it to arrest Luk. Luk flees to the other side of the ship and jumps off onto a cargo dock, then lies atop a giant cargo container as a forklift carries it through the police barrier. Donnie climbs atop a tall stack of cargo containers and sees Luk escape. Luk goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, to tell her that he\\'s returned and will see her soon. Donnie catches up with him and chases him to a beach, where they fight. Madam Yeung arrives and yells at Donnie to stop beating Luk, finally pointing her gun at him. Donnie knocks her gun into the ocean, and she attacks him. Their fight is broken up by Michael and the Hong Kong police, and Luk is arrested again. Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong police officer ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police station in the back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer attacked him in the station. Michael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back to the U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through the driver\\'s window, knocking out the driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through the window into the back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance\\'s inhaler and uses it to avoid the gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight on the roof of the speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through the side windows, and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings to the ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb over to the broken driver\\'s window and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging to the grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives. Madam Yeung organizes a Hong Kong police search team for them. Meanwhile, Luk and Michael are tortured by being tied up in a freezer. A thug played by Paul Wong interrogates, beats, and further tortures them, seeking the negative. Michael manages to free himself from his bonds and knock out the thug, then free Luk. Michael tries to convince Luk to give him the negative, and Luk begins to tell him about it, but they\\'re interrupted by the arrival of a thug played by Michael Woods. Luk and Michael get separated, and Luk hides in a parked car. Michael meets up with three thugs - John Salvitti, Michael Woods, and Stephan Berwick. It is revealed that he is their boss. Meanwhile, Luk uses his electronics skills to get the car\\'s radio working, and he contacts the Hong Kong police headquarters, who locate the signal\\'s source and come to rescue him. Then Michael finds Luk and asks for the negative again. Luk tells him that he lost the negative, and he doesn\\'t know where, but he saw the murderer of the American cop and could recognize him. Michael surreptitiously reaches for his gun, but just then Madam Yeung and the Hong Kong police arrive. They take Luk back into custody, and Michael declares that he\\'s going to extradite him back to the U.S. Madam Yeung drives Luk toward the airport to be flown back to the U.S. On the way, Luk requests to see his mother before leaving. Madam Yeung is reluctantly convinced, and she drives Luk to his mother\\'s home, where they have an emotional conversation as Luk and his mother are overjoyed to see each other, but Luk\\'s mother is devastated by learning that he is suspected of a crime severe enough to involve U.S. police. They also meet up with Donnie. Madam Yeung, Luk, and Donnie walk outside and are attacked by Salvitti, who rides up on a motorcycle and opens fire with an automatic rifle, shooting Luk in the heart. Madam Leung and Donnie carry Luk and flee. Donnie lures Salvitti away while Madam Leung gets Luk to the nearest hospital. Donnie ambushes Salvitti and fights him. Salvitti is almost a match for him, but Donnie manages to beat him up and arrest him. The next morning, at the hospital, Luk is unconscious but past the most dangerous period and will likely recover. Madam Yeung and Donnie argue, with Donnie accusing Madam Yeung of too much sentimentality, particularly for having let Luk see his mother and thereby exposing him to danger, and Madam Yeung accusing Donnie of too much impulsiveness and egotistical attitude. Then Madam Yeung\\'s superior enters the room and berates her for granting Luk\\'s request, but Donnie defends her by claiming responsibility for the decision. Afterward she tries to thank him, but he avoids her. Michael meets with the Chinese cocaine dealer and tells him that his cocaine and Michael\\'s money were both lost to the police, but he promises revenge. The dealer drives off, accompanied by a tough-looking Caucasian woman . Later, at the Hong Kong police headquarters, Donnie interrogates Salvitti while Madam Yeung and Michael watch. Donnie reveals that Salvitti has a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which he explains is a sign of the Field Troop of the U.S. Navy – the symbol of Black Fox, Troop 3. According to the Pentagon\\'s records, on October 26, 1979, was entirely destroyed in the civil war of Nicaragua, but a suspect killed in this case in the U.S. the previous month also had this tattoo. Salvitti taunts Donnie, who brutally beats him. Salvitti surreptitiously injects himself with a concealed needle and dies, making it look like he died from Donnie\\'s beating. Later that day, Michael takes Donnie to the airport, telling him the Hong Kong police complained that Donnie\\'s violence caused Salvitti\\'s death, so Michael has to transfer him back to Seattle. Donnie tricks Michael into thinking he\\'s left, but then doubles back, suspicious. That night, Michael takes Madam Yeung to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the Chinese cocaine dealer plants a bomb under her car. Madam Yeung narrowly avoids the explosion and attacks the dealer, but his female bodyguard drives up and rescues him, and they escape. Later that night, Stephan Berwick rappels down the outside of the hospital and shoots what he thinks is Luk with an automatic rifle through the window, but it\\'s a decoy dummy, and the doctors in the room reveal themselves to be disguised Hong Kong policemen, and they draw their guns and return fire. Berwick flees. Madam Yeung sends the officers after him, then goes to the room where Luk actually is and checks up on him. He\\'s still unconscious. The room is attacked by Paul Wong, who takes Madam Yeung by surprise and stabs her in the neck with a tranquilizer syringe, then draws a large knife and attacks her as she struggles to stay awake. The doctor tries to interfere, but Paul stabs him to death, cuts Madam Yeung, and knocks her out of the way. He tries to kill the unconscious Luk, but Madam Yeung saves him for a few more seconds. Finally he knocks her back again and she\\'s too close to unconsciousness to move, but at the last moment Donnie bursts into the room and attacks Paul. They fight briefly before Donnie kills him. The next morning, Madam Yeung is recuperating in a church along with Donnie and the still-unconscious Luk. She asks him why he didn\\'t return to the U.S., and he explains that he felt something was wrong about the death of Salvitti. She knows that he suspects Michael is one of the criminals, but he doesn\\'t want to admit it, as they\\'re good friends. They argue, but then come to an understanding. Just then Luk wakes and explains all that happened from his perspective. Later that day, Madam Yeung\\'s superior orders her to let Michael take Luk back to the U.S. Madam Yeung secretly organizes a Hong Kong police raid of the Chinese drug dealers\\' lab, but tells Michael, who comes with her, that they\\'re just going to get Luk. They enter the lab, and a huge gunfight breaks out. Madam Yeung pursues the ringleader into a metal stairwell and kills him. His female bodyguard attacks her, and they have a long and brutal fight. Finally the female bodyguard falls down an elevator shaft to her death, despite Madam Yeung\\'s last-minute attempt to save her. As a consequence of Madam Yeung\\'s insubordinate actions, the Hong Kong police chief is forced to declare her under arrest. However, she hasn\\'t returned with Michael. Meanwhile, back at the church, Luk identifies Mr. Robinson to Donnie, who recognizes him as a CIA officer. Madam Yeung goes to Luk\\'s mother\\'s house. There she is ambushed by Michael Woods and Stephan Berwick, who beat her up and capture her, having already abducted Luk\\'s mother. She\\'s rescued by the arrival of a Hong Kong police squad, who chase Michael and Stephan away. One officer stays behind to arrest Madam Yeung, but she knocks him out and flees. Donnie confronts Michael about his suspicions. Michael reveals that he is a CIA officer, and that his division, which includes Mr. Robinson, sells drugs to raise money in order to support a Latin American anti-government force, which is in the U.S.\\'s political interests. He invites Donnie to join them. Donnie refuses, and Michael reveals a deadly syringe concealed in his shoe and unleashes a flurry of quick, vicious kicks at Donnie, who avoids them all and starts to gain the advantage until Michael draws a gun. Donnie flees on foot into the streets, but the hidden tape on which he recorded Michael\\'s confession is destroyed. Michael sees that there was a tape, but doesn\\'t realize it\\'s broken. Michael sends Woods and Berwick after Donnie on motorcycles. Donnie narrowly avoids them for a brief, stunt-filled chase, and then he jumps up and kicks Berwick off his motorcycle and steals it. A long motorcycle chase and fight ensues between him and Woods throughout the streets, hills, and obstacle-filled back alleys of Hong Kong. Finally Donnie gains the advantage, but Woods escapes. Donnie meets up with Madam Yeung, but Michael has framed Donnie for a crime, and now both of them are pursued by the police in a desperate foot chase through a parking garage. They hide in a car trunk, but are found by the Hong Kong police chief. However, the chief conceals them and lets them go, warning them that he can\\'t help them a second time. Back in the church, Donnie, Madam Yeung, and Luk re-convene, and Madam Yeung reveals that Luk\\'s mother has been abducted. Luk re-bandages his chest wound and prepares to go rescue her. On Madam Yeung\\'s suggestion, they call Michael and offer to trade the incriminating tape for Luk\\'s mother. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and Luk walk into Michael\\'s building as Michael watches them on a security camera. A steel gate crashes down behind them. They meet with Michael and his sadistic Chinese bodyguard. Donnie throws the tape to Michael, who catches it, then draws a gun to kill them all. Madam Yeung draws a remote trigger switch and declares that the \"tape\" Michael is holding is a bomb. She makes Michael unload his gun and throw it away, and Luk demands the return of his mother. On Michael\\'s order, his bodyguard opens a blind to reveal that Luk\\'s mother is hanging from ropes outside a grated window, still alive. Luk charges at the window, but it\\'s electrified, and he\\'s thrown to the floor, shocked. Using this distraction, Michael leaps forward and attacks Donnie and Madam Leung. Berwick appears and attacks Madam Leung, and Michael focuses on Donnie. Luk gets up and tries to break the electrified window to reach his mother, but the Chinese bodyguard attacks him with skilled kicks. Three simultaneous fights ensue. Donnie kicks Michael down a staircase and pursues him away from the others. The Chinese bodyguard brutally beats the outmatched Luk, reopening his chest wound. Madam Leung and Berwick have an intense back-and-forth fight before she finally kills him with a kick to the throat. The Chinese bodyguard renders Luk all but unconscious and is about to kill him, but Madam Leung intervenes, and a fight begins between her and the bodyguard. She is more than a match for him, and she soon knocks him out. Donnie chases Michael throughout the building, beating him whenever he catches him, until Michael finds a decorative sword and uses it to attack Donnie. Donnie narrowly avoids the blade until Madam Yeung appears with another sword and begins an armed duel with Michael. Donnie climbs to the rooftop to save Luk\\'s mother, but finds her guarded by Woods. They have by far the longest and most spectacular fight in the film as Woods pushes Donnie to his uttermost limits, almost killing him multiple times and finally throwing him to the edge of the roof. Finally Donnie manages to knock Woods off the roof and to his death with a flying kick. Luk rescues his mother. Michael defeats Madam Leung in their sword duel, cutting her and knocking her to the floor, stunned. He\\'s about to kill her, but Luk saves her and manages to disarm Michael. Michael viciously beats Luk, but Luk\\'s mother reloads the gun and saves him with it. Michael disarms her, but Madam Leung recovers and attacks the now unarmed Michael, gaining the advantage. Michael retrieves the tape bomb and its trigger and takes Luk hostage as Madam Leung retrieves the gun. They reach a standoff, but then Madam Leung shoots Michael through the hand, and she and Luk kick him through a glass railing and off a high ledge to his death. In an epilogue, viewers learn that Mr. Robinson was found guilty of drug trafficking and sent to prison.',\n",

Before he can, though, a distressed Sahiba tells Karan that she loves him and begs him not to leave. He leaves anyway.

Meanwhile, Yogi, who had finally taken a liking to Karan after learning of the \"pregnancy,\" is angry that Karan left and even more angry when Sahiba tells him that she and Karan were never married.

              " 'The series begins with Scarlett attending the funeral of Melanie Wilkes, her ex-sister-in-law and rival for Ashley Wilkes\\' affection, at which her estranged husband, Rhett Butler, is not present. She, heartbroken that he left her, sets out for Tara and is saddened when she learns that Mammy, her mainstay since birth, is dying. When she arrives there, she sends a telegram to notify Rhett about Mammy under the name of Will Benteen , because she knows that he won\\'t come if he suspects she is there. Before Mammy passes away she makes him swear to look after \"her lamb\" Miss Scarlett. He agrees, although he has no intention of honoring the request. After she dies, he and Scarlett have another snipe filled encounter, which culminates in him leaving and her returning to the Atlanta house, determined to win him back.  This section is practically identical to that of the book regarding Scarlett\\'s actions at the funeral and Mammy\\'s death bed.  The major differences in Charleston are that of the attitude and demeanors of the characters, but most notably Scarlett and Anne. Scarlett is not shown struggling with her unease in society but rather is criticized when Anne sees her and Ashley go into his hotel room together, resulting in a steamy kiss. Anne is completely different from her counterpart in the novel; while she is supposed to be a clone of Melanie, she shyly, yet coyly, flirts with Rhett and does other things that neither her character in the book nor Melanie never would have done. The series continues to follow the relationship created between them after the book ceases doing so.  Scarlett continues to distance herself from the same character in the novel as her relationship with her kin is not discovering and assimilating her Irish heritage and family, as much as escaping from her grandfather\\'s household and passing the time. Her decision to go to Ireland is also preceded by cutting off all ties to America as well as the details concerning buying her sister Carreen\\'s share of Tara, which had been donated to the convent as a dowry when she became a nun.  Once in Ireland, Scarlett is faced with two main problems, not the source of her struggles in the novel. She is pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, of whom none of her kin approve. She also faces quandaries and mixed feelings regarding physical force the Irish rebels against British rule, highlighted by comparisons of how they are being treated by the English to how the South was treated by the North.  Scarlett keeps her daughter\\'s birth a secret from Rhett to spite him, thinking that if she grows up not knowing him she will not be like Bonnie, and that she will not love him; eventually, he will meet her and realize that she does not love or even know him and Scarlett will have her revenge. Katie is barely talked about outside of this - her role as the possible manifestation of a demon is completely removed. Anne Hampton-Butler also comes to Ireland with Rhett, which never happened in the novel, and even has a lengthy conversation with Scarlett. Her death from yellow fever is also detailed.  Lord Fenton is much more evil than his role in the novel. He forces a servant girl to have sex with him, and rapes Scarlett as well. The servant girl kills him when he does this, but Scarlett is blamed. This is where the plot completely veers from the one in the novel; she is put on trial and Rhett comes to her aid, finding out about Katie. It is also learned that Colum was killed by Lord Fenton for trying to get him to support the servant girl because she was pregnant with his child. She is very reluctant to confess, but after Scarlett is found guilty of murder, she does. Rhett and Scarlett decide to travel the world with Katie.',\n",

              " 'Mongolia, 1934. The researcher Maple White , together with his assistant Azbek , discovers an unknown world populated by dinosaurs, situated on a plateau in Mongolia. After having found a dinosaur\\'s egg in a cave, White celebrates the discovery, with Azbek, uncorking a bottle of champagne and listening to classical music. Azbek is attacked and killed by Dimorphodons, which also attack White who falls from the plateau holding onto a rope; he survives but is seriously wounded, White is found again and taken care of by Myar and Djena , respectively Azbek\\'s brother and sister; White asks the two to bring him his friend George Challenger  to whom White gives an account of his adventures, proposing to Challenger that he should try to fully explore the plateau in his place. Challenger returns to London, and organizes a lecture to try to convince some people to finance an expedition to prove that dinosaurs still exist despite scientific belief to the contrary. During the lecture, Challenger is derided and humiliated, not only from the students but also from his colleagues Leo Summerlee  and Lord Thomas . However, Lord Thomas ultimately grants permission for the expedition, on the condition that Summerlee accompany Challenger to act as \"a critical eye\". Subsequently, a spectator at the lecture, Oscar Perreault , proposes to pay the expedition\\'s expenses to Mongolia, on the condition that the scientists capture a living dinosaur and to exhibit it to the public wherever he wishes; and that his associate John Roxton David Nerman goes along to represent his interests. Challenger unwillingly accepts the proposal. After concluding the lecture, Challenger bumps into the young journalist Arthur Malone, who he suggests joins the expedition as a documentor. After granting permission to Malone, Challenger is confronted by the same woman who had interrupted his lecture earlier- who reveals herself to be none other than the late Dr. White\\'s daughter, Amanda, who also insists on joining the team in order to represent her father\\'s interests. In the following days, the team heads to Mongolia, stopping on the journey to pick up their guides, including the young siblings Myar and Djena; as the journey goes on, Djena becomes very attached to Malone and strong connection is built between the two. Their transportation suffers a breakdown and the team is forced to continue the trip on foot. One of the guides is killed by what is presumably a prehistoric insect, however, despite misgivings on the part of the guides, the team continues on after conducting a funeral, according to the local rites. The team finally reaches the foot of the plateau where Amanda White is abducted by two natives. Upon noticing Amanda\\'s disappearance the team immediately goes in search of her. Challenger and Roxton quickly find her suspended from a ritual framework by her abductors. In rescuing her, they are also forced to face the native tribe - who are only defeated by use of modern weaponry. The team escapes the charging natives by use of a hot air balloon, in which they fly up the plateau. Using binoculars Summerlee observes three Quetzalcoatlus nearby; the animals prove to be hostile and immediately attack the balloon, knocking the young Myar from it and then causing an irreparable tear to the balloon itself, causing the whole team to plummet to the plateau below. Upon arriving the team is amazed to see a Brontosaurus. After a search the team find shelter in a cave, where they discover a series of intricate symbols on the walls. Roxton decides to return to the wreckage of the balloon to recover his supplies. Upon his return he presents the team with a small Centrosaurus which he wants to sell for $100,000. Roxton the reveals to the team that he intends to make the plateau an area exclusively for high-risk game hunting, and has planned to do so all along. Roxton then orders Malone to tie Djena and Challenger to tie Malone. Taking advantage of Roxton\\'s temporary distraction, Challenger succeeds in disarming Roxton instead and recovers the rifle. However, Roxton aims a knife Djena\\'s neck, forcing Challenger to return the rifle to him. Djena once again distracts Roxton by biting Roxton\\'s hand and Challenger attacks him; ultimately Challenger is able to render Roxton unconscious. Meanwhile, Amanda White and Professor Summerlee are busy trying to decipher the symbols on the cave walls. They are attacked by a dinosaur but are able to fight it off. At the same time, Challenger, Malone and Djena are returning with the tied-up Roxton, and are attacked by a giant crocodile. The crock manages to snap only Roxton, leaving the other three mostly unscathed. Returning to the cave, Amanda White tells the Mongolia\\'s lost world history through the symbols; these tell of a tribe, the kerraks, that have adapted to the place, some dinosaurs were chased by the kerraks, some of which were extinguished and, for this, the native precedents, the neanderthals, chased the kerraks to avoid the total destruction of the lost world, becoming the plateau\\'s custodians. After the story, Professor Summerlee reveals to the team that he doesn\\'t want to return to London, deciding to pass the rest of his life in studying the plateau\\'s environment. Shortly after this a neanderthal appears in the cave, and shoots Summerlee with a blow-gun. The dart causes Summerlee to become very disoriented and experience hallucinations. Under its influence he wanders from the cave and is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The rest of the team finds the dead body of Summerlee, which they cover with a British flag; subsequently. Returning to the cave, Amanda White and Challenger discover that there is, in fact, a larger cave behind the first, the same one discovered by Maple White in the film\\'s first scenes. Exploring the cave the two come across the skeleton of the unlucky Azbek and White\\'s vinyal record. In the same instant, a battered John Roxton, reveals to Amanda White and to Challenger that the cave is full of explosive and that the two cannot be not be saved once he lights the fuse. Roxton is also in possession of a Dimorphodon, which frees itself and attacks him, causing him to fall from the plateau. Before falling however, Roxton manages to light the fuse and Amanda and Challenger barely succeed in escaping. While trying to prepare a parachute, Djena finds a dead velociraptor and is attacked by small eoraptors, which then attack the other team members. Later that night, a Tyrannosaurus attacks the camp; the team tries to escape, but Djena is once again attacked by the small eoraptors, when they disperse Djena is attacked and killed by the T-Rex. Wanting to avenge Djena, Malone distracts the T-Rex by throwing rocks at it . He is ultimately able to kill the T-Rex with a large blast of fire by igniting flammable gas caused by a nearby volcano. Amanda White and Challenger are saved from the hot flash by throwing themselves down from the plateau\\'s frame with the parachute that Deja had been preparing earlier. Returning to London, Challenger communicates the death of his companions to the students. On account of the dangerousness of the place, he chooses to state that the expedition found nothing, thus making sure that no one else goes looking for the plateau.

Dr. Carrington briefs the airmen, and Dr. Redding shows photos of a heavy object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteor. Following Geiger counter readings, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the supply team\\'s C-47. The mysterious craft lays buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft\\'s shape, they realize they are standing in a circle; they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try unearthing it with thermite heat bombs, but ignite the ship\\'s metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Sergeant Bob\\'s Geiger counter points to a frozen body buried nearby. They excavate a block of ice around the tall body and fly it to the research outpost as a storm moves into their region, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives instructions from the Air Force. Corporal Barnes covers the ice block with a blanket, not realizing it is a warm electric blanket; as the ice melts the creature revives, and finally escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm. The creature is attacked by sled dogs and the scientists recover a severed arm. As the arm warms up, it ingests some of the dead dogs\\' blood covering it, and the hand begins moving. Seed pods are discovered in its palm, demonstrating that the creature is a form of plant life. Carrington is convinced that the creature can be reasoned with and has much to teach them, but Dr. Chapman and the others disagree; the Air Force personnel believe the alien may be dangerous. Carrington deduces their visitor requires blood to survive and reproduce. He later discovers the body of a dead sled dog in the base\\'s greenhouse; the alien has forced the lock on the greenhouse\\'s door and bent it back in shape. Carrington has Dr. Voorhees, Dr. Olsen and Dr. Auerbach, stand guard overnight, waiting for it to return. Carrington secretly uses blood plasma from the infirmary to incubate seedlings grown from the alien pods. In the greenhouse, the strung-up bodies of Olsen and Auerbach are discovered, drained of blood. Dr. Stern is almost killed by the creature but escapes. Nikki Nicholson, Carrington\\'s secretary, reluctantly updates Hendry when he asks about missing plasma and confronts Carrington in his lab, where he discovers the seeds have grown at an alarming rate. Dr. Wilson advises Carrington that he has not slept, but Carrington remains unconcerned. Hendry then rushes to the greenhouse after hearing what happened there: the alien visitor is behind the door as Hendry opens it, and he immediately slams the door on the creature\\'s regrown arm as it tries to grab him; as the alien pulls its arm back through, its barbed knuckles rip the door\\'s trim to splinters. The alien escapes through the greenhouse\\'s exterior door and breaks into another building in the compound. Following Nicholson\\'s suggestion, Hendry and his men set a trap in a nearby room: they set the creature ablaze using a flare gun and buckets of kerosene, forcing it to jump through a window into the storm. Nicholson notices that the temperature inside the station is falling; a heating fuel line has been sabotaged by the alien. The cold forces everyone to make a final stand near the generator room. They rig an electrical \"fly trap\", hoping to electrocute the creature. As it advances, Carrington tries to save it by shutting off the power and reasoning with it; the alien throws him aside and continues advancing. An airman throws a pick axe at the creature, forcing it to step on their electrical grid; a switch is thrown and the alien is reduced to ash. Hendry orders all traces of the alien visitor destroyed.

They were driving slowly late at night and attracted the suspicion of two police officers, who wondered if the van\\'s occupants might be burglars. After checking the license plate for violations, the policemen pulled them over for expired paperwork, claimed to have smelled marijuana, then saw a bloody shoe inside the van. However, the paperwork was actually submitted on time , meaning the police had no reason to pull over the van and Hardin has no choice  but to throw out any subsequently discovered evidence, i.e. the bloody shoe. Hardin is even more distraught when the father of the boy attempts to shoot the criminals in court but misses and shoots a cop instead. Subsequently, the father commits suicide while in jail only after he informs Hardin that another boy has been discovered raped and murdered and tells him \"This one is on you, your Honor. That boy would be alive if you hadn\\'t let those men go.\" After hearing all this, Judge Hardin approaches his friend, Judge Caulfield , who tells him of a modern-day Star Chamber: a group of judges who identify criminals who fell through the judicial system\\'s cracks and then take actions against them outside the legal structure. Judge Hardin participates in one of these proceedings in which he presents the case of the two criminals. The Star Chamber declares them \"guilty\" and dispatches a hired assassin. Soon afterward, however, a police detective  comes to Judge Hardin with conclusive evidence that someone else raped and killed the boy. Realizing that he and the Star Chamber have just sentenced two men to die for a crime they didn\\'t commit, Hardin implores the Star Chamber to recall the assassin, but is told by the other judges that the hit cannot be canceled. For the judges\\' own protection, their system includes a buffer between themselves and the assassin; they don\\'t know who he is and he doesn\\'t know who they are. They rationalize to Hardin that although an occasional mistake is inevitable and regrettable, what they are doing still serves society\\'s greater good &mdash; especially, they argue, considering that the two targeted men are clearly criminals guilty of plenty of other crimes, even if not of the specific crime for which the group convicted them. Hardin makes it clear that he does not accept their reasoning. Caulfield warns him to back down because the group will do whatever they have to in order to protect themselves. Hardin refuses to heed this warning and says he will do whatever he can to stop the men from being killed. He then tracks down the men in an attempt to warn them. However, when he arrives, they do not trust him, as he has stumbled across their illegal drug operation.

Their grandmother, called Gam Gam , gives them two tickets to Munich, where a Mr. Schniedelwichsen  will take them to the family resting place. While waiting for Schniedelwichsen after their arrival, the brothers unintentionally start a brawl that takes down an entire Oktoberfest tent. Schniedelwichsen leads Jan and Todd to Beerfest, an underground drinking game tournament run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen . The triumphant German national team is furious that Schniedelwichsen would bring outsiders to the contest, so he is shot. Jan and Todd discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team reveals that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for \"the greatest beer in all ze world\" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother, Gam Gam. The Germans celebrate an easy win over Jan and Todd in a drinking contest and urge the audience to pelt Jan and Todd with vegetables, destroying the urn containing their grandfather\\'s ashes and spilling them all over the brothers. Swearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to Colorado, where they recruit college drinking friends for an American Beerfest team: *Phil \"Landfill\" Krundle ([[Kevin Heffernan , an overweight former brewery employee and competitive eater; *Charlie \"Fink\" Finklestein , a nerdy Jewish scientist with extensive knowledge of beer and chemistry *Barry Badrinath , an amazingly frequent winner of drinking games but currently a homeless male prostitute. During the team\\'s year of drinking training, Jan and Todd find out their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe. Before the Baron Wolfhausen of the time died, he hid the recipe in a doll he gave the boy Johann before Gam Gam took him to the U.S. Since he was the Baron\\'s first-born child, Johann was the rightful heir to the family brewery in Bavaria. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer for the first time in over a generation. It is easily the best beer they have ever tasted . After the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to confront their Wolfhouse cousins and snatch the recipe using various tactics. Disguised as a nurse for Gam Gam, a spy named Cherry   presumably steals the recipe. When Landfill discovers her true identity, Cherry makes him fall into a beer vat, where he dies trying to drink his way out. The team decides to disband, but suddenly, Landfill\\'s very talented twin brother, Gil , shows up and asks to join the team and be called \"Landfill\" as tribute to his brother. In Germany, Jan and Todd have forgotten where Beerfest is held. Getting Todd drunk, though, jogs his memory through what is referred to as \"Drunken Recall\". The team uses an empty wooden keg as a Trojan Horse to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals , Cherry tells Gil at a crucial moment how his brother Phil died, causing Gil to crack and the Germans to win. Jan, still unaware that Cherry stole the recipe, offers the Germans a double or nothing chance. If the Germans win, they get the recipe; if the Americans win, they get the Bavarian brewery. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out the stolen recipe is the wrong one, which prompts Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink\\'s yarmulke, he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage  which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team\\'s anchor fails to finish \"Das Boot\" . A single drop falls from it, disqualifying the German team. The team celebrates in Amsterdam, where they bump into Willie Nelson .

              " 'A missing person case involving a female university student and the victim in a hit and run case appears to be related. Detectives look for a witness. Into the police office walks Min Soo-Ah . She used to be a promising cadet at the police academy, but after a horrific car accident which killed her surrogate brother, Soo-Ah\\'s police career ended. Min Soo-Ah also lost her eyesight in the car accident. Min Soo-Ah reveals to Detective Jo  at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-Ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn\\'t take Soo-Ah\\'s claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-Ah displays her acute senses the detective starts to believe her. Detective Jo and Min Soo-Ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward Kwon Ki-Sub . Kwon Ki-Sub is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witness the hit and run incident. Kwon Ki-Sub also emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan. Meanwhile, Min Soo-Ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man. [Spoiler] It turns out that the gynecologist, Myung Jin  is the mysterious man stalking her as well as the killer. Min Soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent/cologne, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. While in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. The body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and Myung Jin gets out to examine it. When Min Soo-Ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. He leaves her in the rain when another car comes. The reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in. She had gotten angry and stormed out because her ex-guardian tried to give her two things-- tickets to her dead brother\\'s dance group\\'s upcoming dance showdown, and a device that vibrates when a person or moving object-- or any object-- came too close. It would help her with her disability, but Min Soo-ah strongly disapproved of it. One night when Ki-Sub is walking home alone, he is followed by Myung Jin. Ki-Sub at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. An ambulance comes and the Detective/Min Soo-ah drives to the scene. When the Detective finishes up his interviews with the people and follows the ambulance to the hospital, we realize that Myung Jin was in the background, watching Min Soo-Ah in the car. At the hospital, the doctor tells them that because Ki-Sub has such a thick skull, only a small fracture was shown in the X-Ray scan. They are relieved and visits him. Ki-Sub gets annoyed by Min Soo-ah\\'s constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. When he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees Min Soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway, as well as the killer. He calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. As he runs to catch up with her, she goes on Facetime and shows him her location and surroundings. He guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her seeing-dog, Seul-Gi . However, at one point, she trips, but gets up and feels the ground and way out . However, at one point, the killer catches up with her and leads her away, with a knife to her body. She reaches into her handbag and sprays his eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with Seul-Gi. When she reaches the elevator, she thought that she\\'d be safe, but the killer quickly gets in. Ki-Sub, who still sees her surroundings by Facetime, gets scared when he sees blood splatter on the elevator\\'s button and the fact that Min Soo-Ah fainted. However, what they didn\\'t know at the time was that Seul-Gi shielded Min Soo-Ah from the knife and while she was getting stabbed, grabbed the killer by the jacket and led him out of the elevator. In that scene, Seul-Gi dies by being stabbed many times while watching her owner go up through the elevator. When Min Soo-Ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but the doctor handed her the blood-stained leash. At home, Min Soo-Ah listens to many video tapes of her past self, when she had just graduated from the police academy. She laid down and listened to her brother\\'s voice, as well as the voice of the orphanage lady. Halfway through, she gets a call from an unknown number. There is a raspy voice. The caller warns her from this case. \"You can\\'t see me, but I\\'m watching you.\" A few days later, the Detective had narrowed down the number of licensed imported black Sedans and finally, in a garage, he finds the killer. They get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. Meanwhile, Ki-Sub and Min Soo-Ah visits the orphanage again when they\\'re asked to watch over it while the grandmother takes the children out. Ki-Sub finds the dead brother\\'s room and various pictures. Min Soo-Ah goes to the \\'office\\' and finds a cabinet filled with her past memories as a cop, as well as the vibrating motion sensor. The killer enters into the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. Min Soo-Ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. She reprimands Ki-Sub for playing it, but smells the cigarette. Ki-Sub goes upstairs and fights with Myung Jin while Min Soo-Ah runs away. After a few minutes of them playing Cat and Mouse, she lights him on fire and takes the vibrating motion sensor. She helps Ki-Sub outside, where it\\'s raining. Ki-Sub fights the killer again and Min Soo-Ah goes to the car and breaks it with the motion sensor. The killer runs at her with a knife and with the right timing and the motion sensor, she hits him on the head, making him fall unconsious. The police, who had picked up the Detective\\'s body, had found the evidence and eventually found out who the killer was. The killer was put in jail and Min Soo-Ah was re-admitted to the academy and graduated again. Ki-Sub also enrolled into the police academy. It ends with another video, similar to the video of her first graduation, except instead of her surrogate brother, it had Ki-Sub. While the credits roll, you see pictures of them respectfully visiting the Detective\\'s funeral.',\n",

When Jack asks him what he plans to do after this, Peter is stunned to realize that he\\'d never thought that there would be an \"after this\". His sudden fear that he\\'d never leave is furthered by a conversation that he has with Bob and Steve in a bar.

Her brother will slowly drift away with bad or risky companies, will not return home one day, and will be lost forever. Her parents will die heartbroken and her sister will get married suddenly and will leave the family. Babua will go abroad and marry somebody else. It is implied that Anandi is forgetful of her sorrows that she was deceived by Babua  whom she loved most. Babua comes back from abroad only to say: \\'Anandi, I came back to set you free.\\' Bhalo Theko has a non-linear pace with frequent jumps between current time and past. Film critics described Anandi as a large canvas painted in several hues. She stands against rootless internalisation and perplexed culture.

              " 'Wyatt Earp , a retired peace officer, reunites with his brothers Virgil  and Morgan  in Tucson, Arizona, where they venture on toward Tombstone, a small but growing mining town, to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt\\'s friend Doc Holliday , a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger, who seeks relief from his tuberculosis in Arizona\\'s drier climate. Also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theatre troupe are Josephine Marcus  and Mr. Fabian . The married Wyatt attempts to resist a strong attraction to Josephine. Wyatt\\'s wife, Mattie Blaylock , is becoming dependent on laudanum. Just as Wyatt and his brothers begin to benefit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon, they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys. Led by \"Curly Bill\" Brocious , the Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist. Conflict is narrowly avoided upon Wyatt\\'s insistence that he is retired and no longer interested in a career enforcing the law. This is also the first face-to-face meeting for Holliday and Johnny Ringo , who take an immediate dislike to one another. As tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys. Shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house, Curly Bill is ordered by Marshal White  to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill shoots the marshal and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton  and the other Cowboys, who threaten Wyatt, his brothers, and Doc. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton , Frank McLaury , and Tom McLaury are killed, Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan  to the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt\\'s brothers are ambushed: Morgan is killed, while Virgil is maimed. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train. Followed by Ike Clanton and Frank Stilwell, Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely, and then surprises the assassins who had come to kill them. Stilwell is killed, but Wyatt lets Clanton return to send a message. Wyatt announces that he is a U.S. Marshal and that he intends to kill any man he sees wearing a red sash. Wyatt, Doc, a reformed Cowboy named Sherman McMasters , and allies Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, join forces to administer justice. Wyatt and his posse are ambushed by the Cowboys in a riverside forest. Wyatt wades out into the river and engages in a gunfight which ends with Wyatt killing Brocious. Johnny Ringo then becomes the head of the Cowboys. Doc\\'s health is worsening and they depend on the accommodations of Henry Hooker . At Hooker\\'s ranch, they encounter Josephine, learning that Mr. Fabian was shot by Cowboys who tried to steal Josephine\\'s watch. Wyatt finally realizes he wants to be with Josephine, but is unable to commit to her because of his ongoing fight against the Cowboys. Ringo sends a messenger  to the ranch telling Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities and Wyatt agrees. Doc knows he is a better match for Ringo, but is in no condition for a gunfight. Wyatt sets off for the showdown, not knowing that Doc has already beat him to the scene. Doc confronts a surprised Ringo, saying they are just finishing their previous challenge \"to play for blood\". Doc gets the first shot off, hitting Ringo, and killing him. Wyatt runs when he hears the gunshot only to encounter Doc. They then press on to finish the job of eliminating the Cowboys, although Ike Clanton escapes their vengeance after he throws down his red sash. Doc is later sent to a sanatorium in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. After a visit from Wyatt, Doc looks at his bare feet and the condition of the bed in which he is lying: realizing he is about to die with his boots off, he passes away peacefully, muttering \"I\\'ll be damned. Oh, this is funny.\" At Doc\\'s urging, Wyatt pursues Josephine, locating her in Denver. Robert Mitchum narrates an account of their long marriage, ending with Wyatt\\'s death in Los Angeles in 1929.',\n",

After discovering that they are to be roommates, the men become close friends. Tim, who comes from an affluent family, plans a career with the Department of Justice, a fact that doesn't sit well with his girlfriend, Diana , the daughter of Senator Stiles . The couple end their relationship before Tim has a chance to propose. Peter, who is embarrassed by his lower-class roots, plans a career in politics, eventually manipulating his way into a job on a congressman's campaign staff. The friendship between the two men is severely tested when Peter confesses to Tim during a ski vacation that he and Diana have been carrying on an affair behind Tim's back.

Shortly after marrying Diana, Peter falls under the influence of John Palmieri , who has ties to organized crime and political corruption. He bribes Peter into going along with an influence peddling scheme. Meanwhile, things have begun to spiral out of control in Peter's extended family.

After Peter gives his victory speech, he is arrested and charged with political corruption. The movie ends a few months later when Peter drops by Tim's apartment to drop off a bottle of champagne.

He walks out of the woods and into the backyard of some old friends sitting by their swimming pool. He chats with them, then he has a sudden idea: he tells his friends he intends to \"swim\" home across the county by dropping in on friends\\' swimming pools which form a consecutive chain leading back to his house. He dives into the pool, emerges at the other end and starts his journey. At first Ned gets warm welcomes as he meets old friends, mostly upper middle-class, well-to-do people with homes in the upscale outer suburbs. However, there are hints that Ned has been away for up to two years, and he brushes off any questions about himself. Each stop brings him face to face with some aspect of his life. The first one is with his youth when anything was possible, while the last one exposes the current collapse of his family life and where everything seems lost. As the day wears on and Ned sees those who have been closer to him more recently, the welcomes begin to sour. Ned\\'s proud boasts about his wife, daughters and home are met with strong mixed feelings, jeers, suspicion and even anger - especially from women. In one backyard Ned meets a 20-year-old girl  who, years ago, had babysat his daughters. She leaves with him, at first thrilled to do so owing to an unspoken crush she had for him in her early teens.

Outside the hospital Giovanni sees his wife crying but does not comfort her. As they drive off he tells her about his \"unpleasant\" encounter with the sick woman, and is surprised when Lidia dismisses the incident. They drive to a party celebrating Giovanni\\'s new book, which has been well received. Giovanni signs books while his wife looks on from a distance. After awhile Lidia leaves, still shaken by Tommaso\\'s dire condition. She wanders the streets of Milan, ending up in the neighborhood where she and Giovanni lived as newlyweds. She comes across a brutal street fight which she tries to stop, and later she watches rockets being set off in a field. Back at the apartment Giovanni finally hears from Lidia and he picks her up from the old neighborhood which seems to have little sentimental value for him. Later they decide to go to a nightclub where they watch a mesmerising and seductive performance by a female dancer, and engage in small talk. \"I no longer have inspirations, only recollections,\" Giovanni tells his wife. Lidia suggests that they leave the club and attend a swanky party thrown by a millionaire businessman. \"One must do something,\" she says. At the party, Giovanni socialises with the guests and appears to be in his element, while Lidia walks around in a state of boredom.

A man named Roberto  who had been following her approaches and asks her to dance, and she accepts. A sudden rain shower, however, sends the guests running for cover, with some jumping in the pool like children. As Lidia is about to jump in from the diving board, Roberto stops her, takes her to his car, and they drive off together. She enjoys Roberto\\'s company and their conversation, but as he\\'s about to kiss her, Lidia turns away from him, saying, \"I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t.\" Back at the party Giovanni searches through the crowd and finds Valentina alone watching the rain. She tells him she\\'s smart enough not to break up a marriage, and instructs him to spend the rest of the evening with his wife. Giovanni reveals that he\\'s going through a \"crisis\" common among writers, but in his case it is affecting his whole life. They return to the guests, just as Lidia and Roberto return from their drive. Giovanni seems slightly annoyed by Lidia\\'s behavior. Valentina invites Lidia to dry off in her room, where Lidia confronts her directly about her husband. As the women chat, Giovanni overhears his wife tell Valentina that she feels like dying and putting an end to the agony of her life. Noticing Giovanni she tells him that she is not a bit jealous of his playing around with Valentina. They say goodbye to Valentina and leave the party at morning\\'s first light with the jazz band still playing for the few couples still listening. As Giovanni and Lidia walk away across Gherardini\\'s private golf course, they talk about the job offer that Giovanni says he\\'ll turn down. Lidia finally tells him about Tommaso\\'s death, and recounts how Tommaso used to support her and offer his affections to her, but she eventually chose Giovanni because she loved him. She tells him, \"I feel like dying because I no longer love you.\" Giovanni recognizes the failure of their marriage, but tells her, \"Let\\'s try to hold onto something we\\'re sure of. I love you. I\\'m sure I\\'m still in love with you.\" Lidia takes out a love letter Giovanni wrote to her just before they were married and reads it aloud. Giovanni asks who wrote it, and she says, \"You did.\" Giovanni embraces and kisses her, but she resists saying she no longer loves him, and neither does he love her. Unable to acknowledge his own failure, Giovanni continues to make love to her in a sandtrap on a golf course beneath a gray morning sky.',\n",

In a tour of Doctor Stein\\'s home-slash-laboratory, Doctor Walker is introduced to his other patients: a ninety-year-old woman with the appearance of a fifty-year-old woman , and a Frenchman whose lower legs have been successfully re-attached with the help of Doctor Stein\\'s \"DNA solution\". Doctor Walker is startled when she sees one of the Frenchman\\'s legs is tiger-striped, which Doctor Stein attributes to \"an unknown RNA problem\" which he hopes to correct during the course of treatment. His assistant, Malcomb, seems overly interested in her reaction to this sight. Meanwhile, Eddie is being verbally abused by the orderly at the Veteran\\'s Hospital. When Doctors Stein and Walker arrive to ask if he\\'d be interested in submitting to surgery that may correct his limblessness, he consents. Doctor Stein gives Eddie new replacement arms using his trademark \"DNA solution\", and Eddie seems to be recovering well. Malcomb confesses his attraction to Doctor Walker, who explains she intends to marry Eddie as soon as the surgeries are complete. Malcomb\\'s acceptance of her statement has sinister overtones, and he later sabotages the \"DNA solution\" used during Eddie\\'s leg surgeries. As a result, Eddie becomes a moaning, shambling monster reminiscent of Boris Karloff\\'s Frankenstein. He is compelled to leave the house to kill, though he returns in time for his ongoing schedule of \"DNA solution\" injections. The police visit Doctor Stein when the body count reaches three, but Doctor Stein is ignorant of the fact that there is a monster living in his basement. Doctor Walker has become suspicious of Malcomb, and spends her time in the lab, examining the various solutions used during Eddie\\'s surgery. One night, returning from his usual senseless rampage, Eddie hears screaming coming from Winifred\\'s room. He enters to find Malcomb at her bedside, and interrupts an attempted rape. Malcomb runs from the room, and Winifred does nothing but scream in horror until he returns with a gun. He empties the gun into an unaffected Eddie as Winifred flees. Doctor Stein meets Doctor Walker on the stairs, where she tells him Eddie is the monster. Together they run to the lab. Winifred busies herself with a needle and a bottle . When Eddie draws near, he seems moved by her terror, and backs away, remembering that she is his fiancee. Doctor Stein enters from the side and attacks him. After a brief tussle with his creator, Eddie leaves the house. The police arrive to console Doctor Walker and discover Doctor Stein\\'s body. Eddie finds a brunette attempting to start a Jeep, and spends several long minutes unsuccessfully chasing her around an empty industrial warehouse. The police have called for the Los Angeles County Canine Corps. The dobermen surround Eddie, knock him to the ground, and \"eat\" him.',\n",
              " \"Nagavalli is a supernatural thriller; its story revolves around characters living in a house in Tirupati. After a family member receives a Nagavalli portrait as a prize in the Nagavalli Dance competition, various characters start having abnormal experiences. In order to save themselves and unfold the mystery, the family looks to Ramachandra Siddhanthi and Dr. Vijay. The story starts off with an ancient painting of Chandramukhi alias Nagavalli , distributed as a prize to bharathanatyam dancer Gayathri , her husband and her family. Gayathri lives in a palatial house in Tirupathi with her husband, father Shankar Rao , mother Parvathi , sisters Geetha  and Gowri , maternal uncle Appa Rao, his wife and maternal cousins Pooja and Hema happily. Few years later, Gayathri and her Husband are shown to be dead. However, at the Engagement day of Gowri,youngest of the three sisters of Gayathri,one of her friends had fainted by encountering a huge thirty-feet Snake/Serpent, and the bridegroom/fiancé had ran away from the family house fearing of something. All strange incidents happen as the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer had died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The members of the family are psychologically affected by the presence of Chandramukhi's painting and things have not been going well in the house. They decided to contact Acharya Ramchandra Siddhanthi , an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters had told the people and the Acharya that Gayathri and her husband died suddenly after the bharathanatyam competition. The Acharya takes the help of Dr Vijay , a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Chandramukhi, and is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. So the father had warned everyone to not go to the outhouse or to the room where Chandramukhi's painting is. At first both Achrya and Dr. Vijay suspects Geetha due to her strange behaviour. One night, Dr. Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and there was another smaller portrait of Chandramukhi in the outhouse and the Doctor wondered how this portrait of Chandramukhi had come here, and it was revealed that Gayathri is still alive, but became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Chandramukhi, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Gayathri was mad and so Geetha vowed that she wouldn't marry, and since they didn't want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied saying Gayathri was dead. In a few occasions, someone attempted to murder the Acharya twice. Suspecting Gayathri, the acharya asks the family members to bring Gayathri to the temple and that he will show everyone that Chanramukhi is in Gayathri's body, but as Gayathri stepped the temple, all animals were running out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Dr. Vijay starts to investigate everything so he goes to the library to read a book based on Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara 's life and further information on Nagavalli too. The investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara  used to live and how his enmity with Chandramukhi has been going on since centuries, and was revealed that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Dominion and the people to go and slaughter and assassinate him... but the book didn't tell if he got assassinated, or if he really committed suicide or if he is alive. Dr. Vijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him: Chandramukhi... and he understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Chandramukhi, Dr. Vijay goes to Chandramukhi's place and an old man told the Doctor that Chandramukhi's family died back at around a hundred years and told him that he was the second person to enquire about Chandramukhi's family, and as the Doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Chandramukhi, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Chandramukhi's place, she was holding a portrait of Chandramukhi and ran away like a mad girl, so the Doctor goes to Chandramukhi's house and realizes and understands that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Chandramukhi which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Dr. Vijay also investigates about Gayathri's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Gayathri's husband's death had nothing to do with Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay reveals that Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile of his and when the Acharya told Dr. Vijay that this person can still be alive. So Dr. Vijay goes to the Fort/Cage where the crumpled Raja is, and at the time, the Acharya performs a pooja to try to bring Chandramukhi out of Gayathri's body. The Doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when the Acharya asks for Gayathri's name, she says her name as Chandramukhi Gayathri, but is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay comes back to cure Gayathri from her madness, and he succeeds, but the problem of Chandramukhi is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later the Doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Chandramukhi as he makes her angry and change personality from Gowri to Chandramukhi in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to her normal position. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Chandramukhi in Tamil when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the Engagement day and sat downstairs like as if she didn't know anything. In order to know more about Chandramukhi's lover Gunashekharan, she went to Chandramukhi's house as Gowri, and returned with Chandramukhi's photo, completely as Chandramukhi. Afterwards Gowri goes to the cage/fort where Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is, to kill him. Dr. Vijay, knowing Gowri would have definitely seek revenge goes to the cage/fort where the Raja almost gets burnt to death, but he survives when it starts to rain, then Dr. Vijay has a battle with him, and the Raja almosts decapitates Gowri/Chandramukhi, but before he does so, the Doctor finishes off the Crumpled Raja, and it is the end of Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara's story. Gowri is no more affected by Chandramukhi anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too and it all comes to a happy ending.\",\n",

Left with no villains to pursue, the Titans can do nothing more than bow to Beast Boy\\'s desire to enjoy Tokyo as tourists. Investigating alone, Robin is attacked once more by Saico-Tek and they get into a very violent fight which ends with Robin pummeling the ninja into the ground. When Saico-Tek does not rise, the crowd watching believes Robin has murdered his opponent. Commander Daizo apprehends Robin, despite the hero\\'s protestations of innocence, but as he is transferred, a slip of paper bearing the name \"Brushogun\" flits into the armoured car carrying him and explodes, freeing him. Now on the run, Robin co-opts the identity of a Shinjuku mugger who tried to shoot him and reunites with the other Titans, who have themselves been attacked by strange creatures.

With this new information, Robin has no trouble deducing Brushogun\\'s hideout: Beast Boy\\'s favorite manga publishing house. Breaking in, the Titans discover the withered form of Brushogun, wired into a printing press that draws on his powers to create the enemies the Titans have faced. The true villain turns out to be Daizo, who has used Brushogun\\'s powers to create both his Tokyo Troopers and the monsters that they captured so that he could earn a reputation as a hero. A massive battle ensues, culminating in Robin facing Daizo. With no options of escape left, Daizo hurls himself from the catwalk, into the ink reservoir of the press, taking control of Brushogun\\'s magic powers and transforming himself into a giant, hulking mass of ink and machinery, with Brushogun at the center. As the other Titans battle creatures Daizo hurls at them, Robin frees Brushogun. As the old man fades away in his arms like ink, his powers disappear and Daizo is left defeated and exposed.

Once at a dockside warehouse, the frozen Velociraptors escape, who kill many of the terrorists before the police arrive, who expect to find drug smugglers. After finding the sole survivor, the police are killed inside the warehouse by the Velociraptors. An anti-terrorist special force led by Colonel Rance Higgins is called in by General Mercer where they find pieces of bodies and a refrigeration truck rather than uranium. They maneuver through warehouse boxes until two get slashed to death. The survivors learn from Dr. Hodges that these are the last three \"carnosaurs\" in existence: two male Velociraptors and one female T-Rex left from the genetic reconstructions of the previous Carnosaur installments. It is made clear that the dinosaurs need to be caught alive, relating to the potential for curing major diseases. A massive meat shipment resides at the dock, so the three soldiers hunt in that area, meeting up with a unit of Marines who have come as backup. Soldier Polchek is given drugs to shoot into the carnosaurs as the group set up a lure and net trap with meat. One of the carnosaurs attacks and almost succeeds in dragging off Polchek, but is shot down. Hodges soon theorizes that the T-Rex is breeding since Polchek was being dragged off, perhaps to hatchlings. The next plan is to destroy the ship they\\'re on into the Pacific and freeze the dinosaurs somehow. When time comes to explore the lower decks of the ship, the carnosaurs knock out the lights and kill a couple more soldiers. The rest get to an elevator, but a dinosaur chews the cable through and they crash on the bottom level, discovering the nest of eggs which they begin to shoot, causing the T-Rex to become mad, ripping off Polchek\\'s arm. Rance and Proudfoot rejoin Dr. Hodges and Marine Rossi, split up again and rig dynamite. Rossi is eaten by the Rex; Proudfoot\\'s head is ripped off; and the remaining two shoot two of the dinosaurs.

Siddharth  and Avni , the son and daughter-in-law of Badri\\'s elder brother, return to their native village from America and decide to stay in their ancestral palace. Here, Siddharth is crowned as the king, his right to the throne. Events take a twist when Avni opens a forbidden locked room that contains the ghost of Manjulika. Unnatural events start taking place inside the palace. Avni falls in love with the place and learns about Manjulika and her tragic story. Badri and Batuk Shankar  try to ward off the evil eye with the help of a priest, Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti , but unfortunately the priest has gone to London and is unsure when he might return. Siddharth starts suspecting Radha  for all the strange occurrences. He thinks she has gone crazy since he was supposed to marry her, but married Avni instead. He calls his friend/psychiatrist Dr. Aditya Shrivastav  to try to figure out what the problem is with Radha. Once Aditya reaches the palace, things become comical, as everyone thinks he is a fool, though he is in fact very intelligent. Aditya eventually realizes that Radha is not at fault, and that someone else behind it all. One night, he encounters Manjulika and dares her to strike. The ghost angrily vows to take her revenge on the auspicious day of Durgashtami. During the engagement of Nandini, Siddharth\\'s cousin, and Sharad Pradhan , Avni spills food on Sharad and takes him away to get him cleaned. When Aditya and Siddharth search for her, they see that there is a struggle between Avni and Sharad, and quickly intervene. Siddharth thinks that Sharad was violating Avni, but Aditya tells him that Avni is actually the real culprit. It is revealed that Avni has Dissociative Identity Disorder, a disease that affects the person\\'s identity, making them think they\\'re someone else. Aditya explains that Avni is the one making all the strange things happen around the palace. He reveals that he visited Avni\\'s hometown to gather information about her childhood and has factual evidence. He then tells the half-convinced Siddtharth to provoke Avni in order to make him realize that something is wrong. When Siddharth provokes her, Avni shows the dark personality of Manjulika before returning to her usual self, much to the horror and concern of Siddharth, who asks Aditya to save Avni. During Durgashtami, Aditya and Siddharth see Avni consumed in Manjulika\\'s identity, dressed as her and dancing to the tunes Manjulika had been dancing to with her love, Shashidhar, before the king murdered him. The tragic love story of the old king Vibhuti Narayan, who loved Manjulika, who in turn loved Shashidhar, is revealed. Avni imagines herself as Manjulika and Sharad as Shashidhar, dancing in the court of the king. Avni completely assumes the identity of Manjulika and tries to kill her own husband Siddharth; she sees him as the king who had killed Manjulika\\'s lover. To cure Avni, Aditya triggers Manjulika\\'s personality and makes her promise to leave Avni if she gets the opportunity to kill the king and take her revenge. The priest Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti arrives and with his help, during the ritual of Durgashtami, Aditya lays out an intricate plan to trick Manjulika into thinking she is killing the king when she is actually slaying a dummy. After the \"murder\", Manjulika, now content, leaves Avni forever. Avni is healed and everything ends well. Aditya tells Radha, whom he has taken a liking to, that he will send his parents over if she is interested in marrying him, to which a happy Radha gives her silent consent.',\n",

Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, keep refusing to hospitalize him and send him away. Meanwhile, his health deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling and he slowly loses consciousness. The reasons for neglecting him range from the fact that the hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident to the doctors being only humans who are tired, bored, or simply do not feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is the paramedic, who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her. Finally, at the fourth hospital, the doctors accept Lăzărescu for an emergency operation to remove a blood clot in his brain, so that his incurable liver neoplasm can kill him, as one of the doctors in the film cynically comments.\",\n",

The American cowboy and his mustang are placed against the world\\'s greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders, some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner—and especially an \"impure\" horse—from finishing the race. For Hopkins, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor but a race for his survival, as he and his horse attempt the near-impossible desert crossing. He intends to use the purse for saving mustangs. They were important to the Indians, who trained and used them, but the US government was trying to eliminate them to convert the Indians to farming. Throughout the race, competitors try to kill Hopkins and Hidalgo. Chief adversaries include the wealthy, spoiled British aristocrat Lady Anne Davenport , who owns a rival Arabian horse and is used to getting her own way. Another is the Sheikh\\'s nephew, who wishes, contrary to his uncle\\'s decree, to marry his cousin, the sheikh\\'s daughter Jazira . A spirited girl and a horse-rider in her own right, she is rescued by Hopkins from a raid in which the Sheikh\\'s nephew hoped to force her marriage by dishonoring her. She grows to trust the American. A recurring theme in the film is the fact that Hopkins\\' father was European American and his mother a member of the Native American Lakota tribe. The Lakota call him \"Blue Child\" or \"Far Rider\". As a half-breed, he feels sympathy and pity for his mother\\'s people, who are being driven to extinction by the settlers. However, he does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the Wounded Knee massacre, for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing a veil, saying that he mustn\\'t \"go through life hiding what God made you.... like me.\" Near the end of the race, Hidalgo is severely injured and Hopkins is dying of thirst. As he hallucinates, by Lakota tradition he sings a prayer to Wakan Tanka as his death song. But Hidalgo struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to finish the race, which he wins. After Hopkins returns to the United States, he buys many mustangs which would have been killed by the Government in an effort to control Indians. He releases the horses, including Hidalgo, into the wild.',\n",
              " 'After the sudden death of their father, four children — teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie — find themselves penniless and forced to travel with their mother Corinne to live with her wealthy parents . Corinne informs her children that there has been tension between herself and her parents for many years, but does not elaborate and simply says they had cut her out of their lives for something she had done that they disapproved of. The children trust her, though Cathy is skeptical at times. Corinne\\'s mother Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes her daughter and her children into her home, though with the harsh condition that the children must be sequestered away in a locked room so that her husband Malcolm  will never know of their existence. To that end, the children are shut up in one bedroom in the mansion, only with access to the mansion\\'s attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that the grandmother reveals the shocking truth: Corinne and her husband were really uncle and niece, making their love incestuous and their children the product of said incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she has been savagely horsewhipped by her mother as a punishment for her incestuous relationship. Corinne admits to the children that she and their father were uncle and niece, and the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corinne tells the children that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, when he dies they will be free. The film focuses on the children\\'s ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their incestuous conception. The children struggle to survive, even as their mother\\'s visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers. Discovering them sleeping in the same bed one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy\\'s ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father, and after she discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but later on Olivia ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off her hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn\\'t die of starvation. As time goes on, the children are often sick, especially the younger ones. Chris and Cathy manage to secretly remove the hinges from their locked door on a few occasions to sneak out of their room, and discover that their mother has been living a life of luxury as well as dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She does eventually come to visit them again, and they confront her about leaving them there to suffer and ignoring them. Corinne is very defensive and acts insulted, cries that they are cruel to think that she is deliberately neglecting them, or enjoying life while they are locked up. She storms out. Shortly after, Cory becomes deathly ill. The children ask Olivia and Corinne to take Cory to the hospital, which they do, but later Corinne returns to inform them Cory has died. The children are devastated, but not long after they start to suspect that Olivia has been poisoning all of them when their pet mouse Fred is found dead after eating part of a cookie. Chris researches and concludes that Cory and Fred were killed via arsenic poisoning, mixed in the sugar on the cookies they are served with the breakfast. The remaining siblings decide to leave the attic once and for all. Chris sneaks out to steal money before they escape and discovers that their mother is planning to wed Bart Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Though upset, he suggests to Cathy they dress up in fancy clothes from the attic, and use the wedding as a cover to sneak out of the house. When Olivia secretly enters their bedroom the next day, hoping to catch them once more doing something \"evil\", Chris takes her by surprise and beats her unconscious with a bedpost. As they are leaving, Cathy decides they should reveal themselves to their grandfather . However, when they enter his room, they find it empty, with the bed dismantled: the grandfather, Malcolm, has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will, which connects the final dots—Malcolm, still suspicious of his daughter, put a clause in his will which states that if it is ever revealed that she had children from her first marriage, she will be disinherited and lose all of her money. They realize that their mother was the one poisoning the cookies, not their grandmother. The children crash the wedding ceremony and expose their mother to the guests and the groom; Corinne refuses to acknowledge the children as her own or to admit to poisoning Cory. Cathy offers her an arsenic-coated cookie as a wedding present, and in fury tries to force her mother to eat it, chasing her out to a balcony, where after a brief struggle, Corinne falls and is killed when her veil is caught on a trellis, breaking her neck. Afterward, the children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn; the narrator  explains that the children did manage to survive all by themselves although Carrie was \\'never truly healthy\\'. She wonders aloud if her grandmother is still alive, anticipating Cathy\\'s eventual return to claim the family\\'s fortune.',\n",
              " \"The Black Nebula Empire, last seen in Yamato: The New Voyage, lands a huge fortress on Earth and sends out an invasion force, with the Black Nebulan fleet wipes out Earth's space fleets. The fortress contains a bomb capable of destroying half the planet. The Nebulans threaten to use it if they are attacked. The starship Yamato is launched from a secret base and tasked with finding the Black Nebulan home planet, from where the bomb is controlled. The Black Nebula is a double spiral galaxy near the Milky Way. The disc facing Earth is made of black, inert matter obscuring all light from the other disc, so the galaxy has never been seen before. There are three new crew members. Shiro Kato, the original Kato's  younger brother. Sasha is the daughter of Starsha and Mamoru Kodai, and has grown from an infant to a teen in only 1 Earth year. The third new member is Captain Yamanami. The Yamato reaches the other side of the Black Nebula and finds a grand, white galaxy, similar to the Milky Way. They follow a beacon signal to a planet that looks just like Earth. They land, and are greeted by an apparently human woman, Sada, and two officers from the Black Nebulan Empire. They meet the Emperor, Scaldart, who also appears to be a human. He tells them that they are actually back in the Milky Way, in the year 2402. The vortex was a hole in time. The Earth has been under Black Nebulan rule for 200 years, and he is the  governor. Scaldart shows Kodai and the landing party all sorts of collections of Earth's famous artwork, and, up on the Yamato, the video screen scans the surface of the planet to find all of Earth's famous landmarks. Scaldart shows them a time viewing machine which shows the history of the Yamato from 2199 up until the present. Then he shows them the future. The Yamato, orbitting the Earth, is destroyed by the enemy's flagship, the Grodaze, in 2402. The landing crew returns, demoralized, to the Yamato... except for Sasha who seems to know her true destiny. She abandons the party and remains on conquered Earth. while alone on the surface, her mother Starsha appears in a vision. She tells Sasha that she was born between Iscandar and Earth, and that her destiny is to die far from both, in service of both. In orbit, the Yamato is attacked by the Grodaze and its fleet, with Beta particle guns firing on the ship. But the Yamato isn't destroyed as predicted. Sanada surmises that the people the planet was not really human and all of the artwork used as proof were fakes. Could the Earth below them be fake, too? The Yamato fires its Wave Motion Gun at the Grodaze and its fleet, destroying them. But, the tachyon based energy of the Wave Gun has an unexpected reaction with the beta particle energy from the exploding enemy ships. A huge explosion hits the Earth, destroying much of the surface. The Earth, where Sasha remained, dissolves in fire. The fire reveals the black skeleton of a planet. It is not Earth, but the Black Nebulan home planet of Dezarium. It was an elaborate hoax designed to demoralize and defeat the Yamato. Scaldart pulls off the mask he wore to reveal his true Black Nebulan face. Back on Earth, Lt. Arufon frees Yuki, who leads an assault on the fortress. She has a showdown with Arufon, but he is shot by another Earth trooper. Arufon tells her that his people are a race of cyborgs, who gave up their flesh for longer lives as Mechanisms. But they also lost the ability to love in the process. Arufon gives Yuki the plans to the fortress, including instructions on how to disarm its hyperion bomb, and dies in her arms. Sasha manages to survive the incineration of the surface by escaping to the planet's lower levels. She finds a control center and sends a message to the Yamato, telling them that to destroy Dezarium, they must travel to the core through a huge conduit she is about to open. Scaldart announces after her message that if the Yamato proceeds any further, he will detonate the hyperon bomb on Earth. Yuki's radio message interrupts Scaldart, telling the Yamato that she is alive, the invaders and their fortress have been immobilized and that the hyperion bomb has been disarmed. The Yamato speeds though the conduit, dodging all sorts of enemy fire. It reaches the center of the planet where it finds a huge crystal city, looking like a glass sea urchin. The Yamato is hit by a missile and Captain Yamanami is killed. Kodai prepares the Wave Gun, but stops when he realizes this will also kill Sasha. Sasha again radios the Yamato, insisting that they fire since this is her destiny. Scaldart finds and shoots Sasha. An enraged Kodai fires the Wave Gun. The blast sets off an explosive chain reaction. The Yamato does a 180-degree turn and rushes out of the internal chamber, going to emergency warp when it reaches the conduit exit. Dezarium explodes behind them, destroying the delicate gravitational balance between the two sides of the Double Galaxy. They crash into each other, starting the birth of a new galaxy. The Yamato warps home while Yuki looks towards the glowing horizon for their return.\",\n",

              " 'Zifts plot unfolds non-linearly: although the main story after Moth\\'s release from prison is told chronologically, the events leading to his imprisonment are revealed by means of numerous relatively long and not necessarily chronological flashbacks. The story is presented chronologically here. Moth is an ordinary guy from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. At school, he falls in love with the beautiful Ada , later nicknamed \"Mantis\". Out of a desire for money, he agrees to work for a shady neighbour known as Slug . The two plot the theft of a black diamond from the white émigré jeweller Vlad the Bijou\\'s house. The robbery ends in failure as Moth is wounded by The Bijou and captured by the police; Slug manages to escape and is never charged. There is no trace of the diamond, and as Vlad is killed by Slug during the robbery, the police never get to know of its existence. In the Sofia prison, Moth, besides working out to patriotic Soviet music, also befriends his older roommate Van Wurst the Eye , so nicknamed because he has been wearing an ocular prosthesis after losing one of his eyes during a robbery in Barcelona. Besides being an avid boxer and arm wrestler, Van Wurst also has his philosophical views on life, such as a theory about the destructive power of women, which he shares with Moth. Shortly before being released, Van Wurst hangs himself, claiming \"there is no hope outside\". While in prison, Moth is informed by Ada that his son Leonid was born and died of lockjaw while still very young. As Moth is released from prison afterwards, he picks up his civil clothes and his year-old ball of chewing bitumen from the cloakroom and does not miss the chance to swear at an obnoxious guard, who headbutts him to unconsciousness. Outside, Moth is picked by a warrant officer and a younger soldier who drive him in a Chaika to the Baths. In the damp basement of the Baths, he is interrogated and tortured by Slug, now a locally influential member of the communist nomenklatura, who believes Moth knows the location of the black diamond. Moth denies and even doubts the diamond ever existed; he later manages to escape, but not before he consumes iridium-poisoned wine offered to him by Slug. Wandering drunk and intoxicated around Sofia and seeking his old girlfriend Ada, Moth gets to witness the new socialist reality he had only heard about on the prison radio: the look of the city has changed with The Largo and the Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, but the nature of the people has remained essentially the same. The protagonist meets a variety of bizarre characters, such as drug-doing medics, weird patients and local drunks. He ends up in the Saint Nicholas Church, where he meets the priest who had baptized him ; the priest points him to Ada\\'s current whereabouts as a performer in a nightclub under the stage name Gilda .{{cite web}} Moth finds Ada, who is now living with Slug, and has sex with her. He later reveals to Ada that he is aware of the diamond\\'s location: in Vlad the Bijou\\'s coffin. The two go to the graveyard, where Moth first insists to visit the grave of his son. However, he realizes that it is another Leonid\\'s grave  and that he never actually had a son. At the same time he notices Slug standing behind him with Ada, who had apparently betrayed him. The three head to The Bijou\\'s grave; while digging, Moth kills Slug with his pickaxe, but is fatally wounded and stunned by Ada a moment later. Moth wakes up in the gravediggers\\' shed. Realizing his impending death, he asks for his bitumen in order not to die with a foul breath. Tearing the bitumen apart, Moth reveals the black diamond had been stashed within it for all those years. He swallows the diamond and dies.',\n",

Friday November 27, 1987. B7. Google News 11/28. In Italy, wealthy families often hire bodyguards to protect family members from the threat of kidnapping. A wealthy family that needs a bodyguard hires Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA agent, to protect their daughter, Samantha \"Sam\" Balletto. Creasy has been broken down from all of the death and horror of combat he witnessed in the Vietnam War and in Beirut, Lebanon. Although Creasy is not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a twelve year old youngster, he accepts the assignment because he has no better job offers. Creasy barely tolerates the precocious child and her pestering questions about him and his life. But slowly, she chips away at his seemingly impenetrable exterior, his defenses drop, and he opens up to her. They become friends and he replaces her parents in their absences, giving her advice, guidance and help with track. Creasy\\'s life is shattered when Sam is kidnapped. Despite being seriously wounded during the kidnapping, Creasy vows her safe return, and vows vengeance on the kidnappers. Ringel said that the film \"is actually two movies rather clumsily stitched together.

              " 'The film is about a young boy from Khuzestan province, in the south of Iran, during the Iran–Iraq War. His parents are killed in a bombing raid on his home village and he escapes on a cargo truck to the north. Eventually he gets off and finds refuge on the farm of a Gilaki woman, Na\\'i, who has two young children of her own. Initially, Na\\'i tries to shoo Bashu away, but later takes pity on him and leaves food out for him. Although Na\\'i is initially ambivalent toward Bashu, and he is initially suspicious of her, they come to trust one another, and Bashu becomes a member of the family, even calling Na\\'i \"mom\". Being that Bashu speaks Arabic, while Na\\'i and her children speak Gilaki, they have trouble communicating with each other, although Bashu is able to speak and read Persian . In a gesture of reciprocation and perhaps love, Bashu cares for Na\\'i when she falls ill, as she had done for him, crying for her and beating a drum in prayer. Throughout the film, Na\\'i maintains correspondence with her husband, a war veteran looking for employment, who has been gone for quite some time. She tells him about Bashu, and implores him to return home in time to help with the harvest. Bashu becomes Na\\'i\\'s helper on the farm, and even accompanies her to the bazaar to sell her goods. Throughout the film, Bashu sees visions of his dead family members, which cause him to wander off. Ultimately, however, he and Na\\'i are always reunited. The other adults in the village harangue Na\\'i about taking Bashu in, often deriding his dark skin and different language, and making comments about washing the dark off of his skin. In addition to the village adults, the school age children taunt and beat Bashu, although the children prove ultimately to be more willing to accept Bashu than the adults. In one scene in which he is being taunted, Bashu picks up a school book and reads aloud a passage stating, \"We are all the children of Iran.\" Before this point, the children had assumed Bashu to be either mute or stupid. In the end, Na\\'i\\'s husband returns home with no money and missing an arm, having been forced to take on dangerous work that is never identified. He and Na\\'i argue over her having kept Bashu against his wishes. Bashu comes to her defense, challenging the strange man to identify himself. Na\\'i\\'s husband tells Bashu that he is his father, and upon this realization, they embrace as though they were always a part of the same family.

Undergoing extreme mental and physical training, they become virtual sociopaths, with no understanding of anything except military routine and war. A priority of the conditioning is that these soldiers are forbidden to speak unless spoken to, completely ignore physical pain, and to address whomever they are speaking to, women included, as \"sir\". At age 38, Todd  is a hardened veteran of many battles, but he and his unit are about to be replaced. Colonel Mekum  introduces a new group of genetically-engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotions except aggression. Todd\\'s unit\\'s commander, Captain Church  insists on testing the \"new\" soldiers\\' abilities against his own. But Todd, the unit\\'s best soldier, is no match for Caine 607 . In the final trial, a fight between Caine and three \"old\" soldiers, two of Todd\\'s comrades are killed, though Todd manages to gouge out one of Caine\\'s eyes before he is defeated. Todd seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious. Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining \"old\" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles. Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high wind velocities. Though badly injured, Todd limps his way toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet\\'s ubiquitous mountains of trash. Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has great difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning. Todd\\'s prior training of not speaking unless spoken to  make it difficult for him to answer questions in anything more than curt replies, and actually initiating a conversation is impossible for him. Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is sheltered by a settler named Mace  and his wife Sandra . Todd develops a silent rapport with the couple\\'s mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized mentally and physically by a snakebite. In a subsequent conflict with a curled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself; however, his parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd\\'s apparent instability. Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the colonists  for an enemy, nearly killing him. The settlers decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and order him to leave. Outside the colony, he sheds tears. He is confused, not understanding what they are, implying that this is the first time that he has cried. Shortly thereafter, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, and are saved at the last second by Nathan, using Todd\\'s technique. Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect himself from the snakes and that he has an important role to play in their community, and decides to leave on his own to find and bring him back. The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on a training exercise. Since the planet is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the colonists\\' presence is unlawful and, as practice, orders his troops to slaughter them. Spotted by the arriving troops, Mace is killed just after he finds Todd. Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd\\'s years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the settlers. Nervous that a much larger enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum, grudgingly accepting Captain Church\\'s advice, orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmanoeuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is finished off in hand-to-hand combat. Panicking, Mekum orders his ship\\'s crew, composed of Todd\\'s old squad, to activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the entire planet, then orders the ship to lift off before they are back on board. When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades, now recognizing him as the ranking officer as a side effect of their conditioning due to their dismissal by Mekum, silently side with him over the army that has discarded them. Todd and his comrades take over the ship, tossing Mekum and his aides out onto the planet, and evacuating the remaining colonists just as the bomb detonates. Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists\\' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.

After thawing the body to perform an autopsy, scientists discover to their amazement a real possibility to revive him and their attempt to resuscitate the \"iceman\" proves successful. While being revived, the dazed caveman is alarmed by the surgical-masked figures; only Shephard has the presence of mind to remove his mask and reveal his humanity and somewhat familiar face to the terrified caveman, permitting the caveman to settle back into a more peaceful sleep and make a full recovery. The scientists place the caveman in an artificial, simulated environment for study. The caveman quickly discovers the modern apparatus and environmental controls, and understands he is still far from home. Shephard believes that the caveman\\'s culture may provide clues to learning about the human body\\'s adaptability, citing ceremonies such as firewalking and the Sun Dance. Several other scientists in the research base see the potential in studying the caveman\\'s DNA and his survival in the ice, as they see it mainly as a case to advance medical science by \"freezing\" the sick or injured in order to suspend their bodies until treatment. Shephard\\'s affinity with the caveman grows to the degree that he begins to defend the caveman\\'s right to be considered a human being and not a scientific specimen. Despite opposition from the rest of the staff, Shephard initiates an encounter with the caveman. Shephard names him \"Charlie\" after the iceman introduces himself as \"Char-u\". Shephard and Charlie bond, but it becomes obvious to the anthropologist that Charlie misses his world; he is terrified and confused by the unknown world in which he awakens. An eminent linguist is brought to the Arctic base to help understand Charlie\\'s language. As Shephard begins to communicate with Charlie, he realizes that he will never be able to help Charlie understand that the world and community he came from have long since disappeared. This fact is made even more poignant when Shephard introduces Charlie to a female colleague. Assuming that the woman is Shephard\\'s mate, Charlie makes chalk marks which indicate that he likely was a married man with children before he was frozen. Shephard strives to understand what motivates Charlie and why, of all the cavemen, he should survive being frozen. At one point, Shephard begins to sing \"Heart of Gold\", inspiring Charlie to sing one of his own songs. Charlie\\'s seemingly incidental bird-like line drawings in the ground resembling body markings on his chest take on a new significance when the base\\'s helicopter strays over the roof of the base\\'s artificial tropical eco-zone, causing Charlie to take on an almost obsessive zeal as he climbs towards the roof. Shouting the word Beedha over and over, he lifts his arms towards the helicopter in a sign of obvious worship. Even though the helicopter pulls away from the dome, Shephard knows that Charlie can now think of nothing else. Charlie escapes after watching Shephard exit the biosphere and in a panic of seeing unfamiliar modern devices and believing there are enemies, spears Maynard. Recapturing Charlie, the other scientists, led by Dr. Singe , focus on what they can learn from him, using him as a subject rather than a person. They attempt to re-freeze the iceman in order to study the effect of thawing on Charlie\\'s physiology and determine what benefit may result. The incident goes awry as Charlie nearly dies in the attempt. Shephard consults local Inuit who recognize the name that Charlie chanted and explain that it is a mythical bird -- a messenger from the gods who comes to take good people to heaven, while sinners are sent to a kind of purgatory. Shephard has long known that Charlie has a spiritual dimension and now sees that he was on a dreamwalk pilgrimage, a mythical quest for redemption. His people were dying in the sudden ice age; he must have offered himself to the gods in the form of a self-sacrifice or appealing to the gods to redeem his tribe. Shephard defies all protocol to help Charlie to escape, because he realizes that Charlie would never survive in the modern world, and Charlie\\'s peace-of-mind and fulfillment are of prime importance to Shephard. Delighted with his freedom, Charlie races on ahead of Shephard as they pass by glaciers and vast ice-shelves, and a crevasse opens up in front of Shephard, cutting him off from Charlie. Meanwhile, the other personnel give chase. The helicopter emerges over an ice-shelf before Charlie. Shephard looks on helplessly as Charlie climbs up towards the aircraft and grabs hold of one of its landing skis. In an attempt to evade Charlie\\'s grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky. The co-pilot offers a hand to Charlie to save him, but an elated and ecstatic Charlie cries out and releases the aircraft, seeming to float through the sky while he plunges. Shephard\\'s initial horror turns into joy as he realizes that Charlie has reached his goal.',\n",

Gilbert Grape  is busy caring for his mentally disabled brother, Arnie , as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during their early camp ritual at a nearby recreational area. His mother, Bonnie  is morbidly obese after years of depression following her husband's suicide by hanging himself. She hasn't left the house in years, and is always found sitting on the sofa watching television. With Bonnie unable to care for them by herself, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing their shanty of a farmhouse while looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing up the town water tower if left unsupervised for too long. All the while his older sister Amy  and younger sister Ellen  slave away in the kitchen. The relationship between the brothers is one of care and protection. In order to cope with his frenetic life, Gilbert has taken on a secret love affair with a housewife, Betty , whilst her insensitive, unsuspecting husband Ken , is fully intent on selling Gilbert insurance for his family. A new chain supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery store where Gilbert works, as well as threatening all the other small-time businesses in Endora. The chain supermarket stocks all kinds of goods, rendering many of the local shops redundant. While the family prepares for Arnie's upcoming 18th birthday party, a young woman named Becky  and her grandmother are stuck in town when their truck towing their trailer breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. In order to spend time with Becky watching the sun set, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bathtub by himself, believing he is now old enough to get out on his own. He returns home late and wakes up the following morning to find Arnie still in the bath, shivering in the now-cold water. He puts a towel around him but yet again Gilbert gets the blame for leaving him. Gilbert's guilt is compounded by his family's anger.

Later at home, Arnie wonders what is in a big box that Gilbert had left in the fridge. He finds a birthday cake and gets caught eating it, which Gilbert told him not to touch. Gilbert orders Arnie to take a bath as punishment, and Arnie resists when Gilbert tries to force him. Losing his temper, Gilbert strikes Arnie hard making him bleed. Appalled at himself and angry at his life in general, Gilbert drives away, leaving Endora. Arnie leaves the house to find Becky, who takes care of him. Gilbert returns to town and sees Arnie with Becky, who is able to get him to enter the lake. Arnie falls from a branch in a tree and goes in the lake, thus helping him overcome his fear of water.

Ramanathan  comes to his father to ask for some financial help by selling their family home in the village and Muthiah gets upset. While upset, the father slips and falls into a well. He is treated in the hospital, but the father succumbs to his injuries and passes away. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships too, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story however revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well-being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people. It also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well-being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family. It is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles—the father by actor Rajkiran and role of the mother by actress Saranya Ponvannan. The director, Cheran, has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children. The modern viewer can appreciate the life lessons witnessed in Cheran's Thavamai Thavamirundhu.\",\n",

Tum-Tum seems to be the only one interested in traveling to Japan, and even then only hopes to go and watch Sumo wrestlers due to the amount of food they are able to consume every day, while Mori intends to return a dagger to the Grand Master at a martial arts tournament that he had won 50 years prior from a boy named Koga . Meanwhile, in Japan, a figure dressed in all black ninja attire sneaks into a museum. After defeating several guards, the mysterious figure makes off with a valuable sword and escapes via a hang glider into the night.

Marino , and Tum-Tum\\'s self obsession with food breaks several plays, though not before a very flatulent batter breaks wind, causing the youngest of the Douglases to pass out. A huge in-game fight causes the umpire to call off the championship game, delaying it a week, driving a nail into Mori\\'s plans to take his grandchildren to Japan as they wish to remain and finish the game. Enroute to the airport, a sticker falls off Tum-Tum\\'s bag, and Sam picks up the wrong one, thinking it is Mori\\'s bag. After Mori departs, the kids discover three intruders at Mori\\'s house and fend off the property.

              " 'The fishing town of Antonio Bay in California is about to celebrate its centennial. With preparations for the celebration underway, the centennial is also marked by a series of ominous events; as the witching hour strikes and the date of the town\\'s centennial begins, various odd phenomena begin to happen all over the sleeping town - objects move by themselves, television sets turn themselves on, gas stations seemingly come to life, and all the public payphones ring simultaneously. That same night, Father Malone, the town\\'s alcoholic priest, is in his study in the church when a large piece of stone falls from the wall revealing a cavity. Inside is an old journal, his grandfather\\'s diary from a hundred years earlier. Father Malone removes the book from the wall and begins to read. The diary reveals that in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay  deliberately sank and plundered a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane. The ship was owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. During a foggy night, the six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the ship, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship. A supernaturally glowing fog appears, spreading over the sea and moving against the wind. Three local fishermen are out at sea getting drunk when the fog covers their trawler. When two of them go on deck to investigate, they see a ghostly looking clipper ship pulling alongside their trawler. The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper ship\\'s crew, who have come back on the hundredth anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to take the lives of six people: symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators. Two of the fishermen are attacked and slaughtered on deck, while the third is killed in the wheelhouse. At the same time, town resident Nick Castle drives down a country road and picks up a young female hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. While the two drive towards town, the radio and headlights of Nick\\'s truck start to fail and all the windows inexplicably shatter. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood, part of a board, that was found on the beach by her young son Andy. The wood is inscribed with the word \"DANE\". Intrigued by the object, Stevie keeps it and takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show from. Stevie sets the board down on top of a tape player that is playing, and while she is momentarily distracted, the board inexplicably begins to seep water. The water spreads and causes the tape player to short out. Suddenly, a mysterious man\\'s voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, and the words \"6 Must Die\" appear on the wood before it bursts into flames. A shocked Stevie quickly extinguishes the fire, but then she sees that the board once again reads \"DANE\" and the tape player begins working normally again. After locating the missing trawler, Nick and Elizabeth find the corpse of Dick Baxter with his eyes gouged out. The other two fishermen are nowhere to be found. The body is taken to the local coroner\\'s office to be examined by Dr. Phibes, who is perplexed by the body\\'s advanced state of decomposition considering Baxter died only hours earlier. Whilst Elizabeth is alone in the autopsy room with Baxter\\'s corpse, the body becomes momentarily re-animated. It rises from the autopsy table and grabs Elizabeth. As Elizabeth screams, Nick and Phibes rush back into the autopsy room, where they see the corpse lifeless again on the floor. However, it appears to have scratched the number \"3\" into the floor with the scalpel. Baxter was the third victim to die. While this is happening, Kathy Williams, the wife of one of the missing fishermen and one of the driving forces behind the town\\'s centennial, and her assistant Sandy Fadel visit Father Malone to ask him to give the benediction at that night\\'s ceremony. He reads to them from the journal and reveals to them how the town was founded on murder and their celebration would be honoring murderers which is something the two women do not want to hear. That evening, the Antonio Bay centennial celebration begins in the center of town. Kathy is told by the sheriff and Nick about her husband\\'s disappearance, but insists on going on with her part in the ceremonies. At the same time, Dan, the local weatherman, calls Stevie at the radio station to tell her that another fog bank has appeared and is moving towards town. As they are talking, the fog gathers outside the weather station and Dan hears a knock at the door. Leaving Stevie on the phone while he goes to answer it, Dan is killed by the ghosts as Stevie listens in horror. As Stevie continues her radio broadcast, the fog begins moving inland and neutralizes the town\\'s phone and electricity lines. Using a back-up generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son when she sees the fog closing in from her lighthouse vantage point. Nick and Elizabeth hear this on the car radio and go to help. Meanwhile, at Stevie\\'s home, her son\\'s babysitter, Mrs. Kobritz, is killed by the ghosts as the fog envelops the house. The ghosts then pursue Andy, but Nick arrives just in time to save him and they escape. As the town\\'s celebration comes to an end, Kathy and Sandy are driving home when they turn on the car radio and hear Stevie warning people about the dangerous fog that is sweeping through the town. Stevie advises everyone to go to the local church, which appears to be the only safe place. Nick, Elizabeth and Andy hear the same message and the group gather at the church. Once inside, they and Father Malone take refuge in a small back room as the fog begins to roll outside. Inside the room, Nick and Father Malone find a huge gold cross buried in the walls. The cross is made of the gold that was stolen from Blake and his people a hundred years earlier. As the ghosts of Blake and his crew begin to attack the church, Father Malone takes the gold cross out into the chapel. Knowing he is the offspring of one of the conspirators, Malone confronts Blake in an attempt to sacrifice himself and save everyone else. Back at the lighthouse, two of the ghosts try to attack Stevie. She climbs onto the roof, but the ghosts follow and trap her. Inside the church, Blake seizes the golden cross, which begins to emit an eerie glow. The church rumbles as the light emanating from the cross becomes brighter and brighter. Nick manages to pull Father Malone away from the cross only seconds before it disappears, along with Blake and his crew, in a blinding flash of light. The ghosts attacking Stevie on the roof of the lighthouse disappear as well, and the fog vanishes. Stevie gets back on air and warns the boats out at sea to watch out for the fog. Later that evening, Father Malone is alone in the church pondering why Blake did not kill him and thus take six lives. At that moment, the fog reappears inside the church along with Blake and his crew. As Father Malone turns to face him, Blake swings his sword at Father Malone\\'s neck, decapitating him.',\n",

              " 'Infernal Affairs focuses on a police officer named Chan Wing-yan , who goes undercover into a triad, and triad member Lau Kin-ming , who infiltrates the police department. Each mole was planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with. The prologue opens with the introduction of triad boss Hon Sam , who sends a number of young gangsters to the police academy as moles, among whom include a young Lau . Concurrently, a young Chan  joins the police force but is expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing and Principal Yip. In reality, Chan has become an undercover agent reporting directly only to Wong and Yip. Over time, Chan experiences great stress from work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chan and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other\\'s identity. Soon after, Chan attends the funeral of Yip, who had died recently, leaving Wong as the only person who can identify Chan as a cop. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chan using Morse code, but Lau alerted Hon, giving Hon enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chan sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau\\'s face clearly. He attempts to follow Lau secretly as they leave, but loses his target when his phone rings suddenly at the crucial moment. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double identities – Chan starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background. When Chan meets Wong again on the same rooftop, Wong intends to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. They are unaware that Lau has his subordinate, CIB Inspector B, and his team tracking him. Meanwhile, Hon sends Tsui Wai-keung, Del Piero, and a gang of henchmen to confront them after receiving intel from Lau. Inspector B informs Lau and sends an OCTB squad to save Wong. Chan flees from the building using a crane while Wong sacrifices himself to save Chan by distracting the thugs. Wong is recognised by the gangsters, who beat him up severely before throwing him off the roof. As the police close in, a shootout breaks out, resulting in three gangsters being killed, one of whom is Piero. In the aftermath of the gunfight, the OCTB squad arrives with Lau and Wong\\'s second-in-command, Inspector Cheung, on the scene. Lau retrieves Wong\\'s cellphone and contacts Chan, with both of them reaching an agreement to foil a drug deal by Hon. The plan succeeds and many of Hon\\'s men are arrested, while Lau betrays Hon and kills him. Everything seems to have returned to normal – Chan can revert to his true identity as a cop, while Lau has erased his criminal connections by eliminating Hon\\'s triad. However, back at the police station, Chan discovers that Lau was the mole and he leaves immediately. Lau, realising what has happened, erases Chan\\'s records as a cop from the police database. Chan spends an evening with his therapist Lee , with whom he has fallen in love. He sends to Lau a compact disc with a recording that Hon kept between himself and Lau, but the disc is inadvertently intercepted by Lau\\'s girlfriend Mary . Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau without resistance and holds his Glock 17 to Lau\\'s head, as a rebuke to Lau\\'s plea for forgiveness and request to remain as a cop. Inspector B arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into an elevator, but upon moving his head from behind Lau he is suddenly shot in the head by Inspector B. Inspector B then reveals to Lau that he is also a mole planted by Hon. As they take the elevator down to the lobby, Lau kills B, most likely out of his desire to eradicate traces of his past and become a \"good guy\" cop and end the hunt for a mole. The original ending climaxes with Lau identifying himself to the police as one of them. Dr. Lee Sum-yee discovers Yip\\'s records at the academy, revealing Chan as the undercover officer; B is blamed of being the mole and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral, with Cheung and Lee present as well. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life.

              " 'After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie , the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie\\'s replacement is Brian Clough , the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie\\'s management. Furthermore, Clough\\'s longtime assistant, Peter Taylor , has not joined him. The roots of Clough\\'s conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First DivisionThough Leeds were leading the table, they did not win the league that season, eventually finishing fourth. The eventual winners were Manchester City and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2&ndash;0.Although Leeds did beat Derby 2&ndash;0 in the FA Cup that season, in reality the game was played at United\\'s Elland Road ground. It was the second of three games between the two sides that season, the FA Cup tie being sandwiched between the two legs of a Football League Cup Semi-Final. Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay , along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson  is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5&ndash;0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson\\'s advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner ([[Stephen Graham  sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them easily, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.In fact, the match between Derby and Leeds took place before Derby\\'s quarter-final match, which they won despite their injury list. Their eventual defeat by Juventus was with a nearly full-strength squad, and Clough blamed Juventus\\'s gamesmanship, rather than Sam Longson for Derby\\'s exit. Later that year, after Taylor suffers a heart attack, Clough tries to secure his position by offering up his and Taylor\\'s resignations. To his horror, the club\\'s board call his bluff, terminates their contracts and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again . Derby fans\\' outrage raises Clough\\'s hopes of being reinstated, but Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. During the holiday, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives.The film shows him effectively reneging on his deal to take over at Brighton, although in reality he had nine relatively unsuccessful months as manager there. Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways. Back in the storyline\\'s \"present,\" Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they \"never won any of them fairly,\" and then making them start with a 7-a-side game. The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough\\'s debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds\\'s captain, Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match on penalties, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough\\'s contract - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted and fundamentally dishonest, both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time . After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor\\'s dictation, but they reconcile. In the film\\'s epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie proved a complete failure as an England manager, and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor meanwhile reunited at Nottingham Forest, where he repeated his prior achievements with Derby by taking them up and winning the First Division, and this time bettered both Revie and his own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession. The film ends by branding Clough \"the best manager that the English national side never had.\"',\n",
              " \"The film, set in a fictional high school, tells the story of a love triangle between Xandrie , and two step-brothers, Zack ([[Alex Russell  and Darren .{{Cite news}} The film begins with Zack and his friends, Brook and Jonathan, at the beach, where they presumably leave the unconscious Xandrie on the coast. Then it rewinds up to the events leading to that scene. Zack's step-brother, Darren, is the complete opposite of him. He likes to spend time in front of the computer, and he doesn't associate himself much with other people. He likes to swim, and is a part of Zack's swimming team, although he just swims because he likes it. A bubbly and intelligent girl, named Xandrie, takes a liking to him. To spend more time with Darren, she decides to attend one of Zack's extravagant house parties with her friend, Ella. Meanwhile, Zack's friends notice her infatuation with Darren, and Zack's interest on her. During the party, Xandrie fails to meet up with Darren; they were unable to find each other in the crowd. Zack's friends, Simone and Karenn, put something on Xandrie's drink and takes her and Ella in the basement, where Zack and his other friends are. Inside, Xandrie experiences the effects of the drug and subsequently falls out of consciousness, and Zack and his friends assault and rape her. Meanwhile, Darren, barred by Brook from following her, decides to go back to his room and falls asleep instead. Zack, Brook and Jonathan take Xandrie to the beach, and leaves her for dead. The next morning, Darren finds Xandrie's phone in the basement, and at school, he is unable to find her. Even Ella doesn't know where she is. Darren confronts Zack, who denies knowing where she is. Meanwhile, Darren hallucinates about Xandrie, regretting how he wasn't able to spend much time with her. Wanting answers, Darren questions Jonathan and beats him up, but he is unable to get answers from him. He tracks Xandrie's home address and visits her, but she isn't home. A few days pass, and Xandrie becomes the topic of negative rumors. But Xandrie returns, much to the surprise of everyone, especially Darren. While with Ella, Xandrie is approached by Karenn and Simone, with the former subtly warning her that it's only her word against theirs. Xandrie then subsequently remembers what happened after waking up at the beach. She went home and ignored Darren while he knocked on her home. Darren, still wanting to find out about what really happened, sneaks and downloads some files off of Jonathan's laptop. He finds out about what really happened, and dreams of killing those responsible. Darren finds time to see Xandrie, and offers her phone back, but she declines. Darren convinces her about not being part of what happened. She rejects his apology, saying that everyone's already made up their mind about what really happened. Unable to sway her, Darren goes home, remembering how he first met Zack. Meanwhile, Zack visits Xandrie at her house, and tells her to keep her mouth shut because no one is going to believe her anyway. Beneath his solid demeanor, Zack feels the guilt as he thinks about the consequences of his and his friends' actions. Darren meets up with Xandrie late at night, and she tells him that she's planning on leaving, calling their school a parallel universe. The two eventually make up. The next day, Xandrie arrives at the school with a gun, and meets up with Darren. Meanwhile, Zack and Brook talk about how Darren is a liability, and Zack allows Brook to beat him up. Brook finds him just as Xandrie left, and punches him in the face. Darren runs and Brook gives him a chase inside the library. Darren sees Xandrie there, contemplating while holding the gun. The two eventually attract a crowd. Jonathan traps Darren with the crowd of students, and Brook proceeds to beat him up. Zack arrives and walks in, telling Darren that he deserves it because he went against him. He asks Brook and Jonathan to escort him out and fix the mess. Xandrie arrives in front of him, pointing the gun right in front of his face. Zack warns her that killing him won't change anything; she still won't convince everyone that she isn't crazy and that he's innocent. While outside with Brook still beating him up, Darren hears a gunshot from the inside, with everyone running out. Dizzy, he manages to go in, and sees Xandrie's dead body, who apparently committed suicide, unable to shoot Zack. The following days, Zack throws another party. Meanwhile, Darren devices a plan with his friend, Shay O'Brien, and coerces him into making Zack comment on his friends negatively, and films it. Meanwhile, Darren convinces Simone to drug Zack's drink, to which she reluctantly agrees because of his threats. Everyone in the party finds out about the video Darren let out, with Brook and Jonathan finding out about Shay's conversation with Zack. Various televisions inside house open up, revealing two empty seats, much to everyone's confusion. Zack goes and follows Darren  in the basement, but he falls unconscious. When he wakes up, he is bound in one of the seats, with Darren pointing a gun at him. Everyone in the party watches while this happens, and Darren needs the votes of the students through text, in order to find out who should be killed. He sits beside Zack, and waits as the students send their votes via text message. A gun devised by Darren automatically kills one of them, depending on who gets the most votes. The gun eventually shoots, apparently killing one of them.\",\n",

              " 'The film begins with Ron Kovic\\'s childhood during a summer in Massapequa, New York. He plays war in the woods, attends a Fourth of July parade, plays and wins at a local neighborhood baseball game, and watches President John F. Kennedy\\'s inaugural address, which later inspires him to enlist in the Marines. After Ron Kovic and his classmates hear an impassioned lecture about the Marine Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom because he is unable to secure a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving. The film then moves to Kovic\\'s second Vietnam tour in October 1967. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, named Wilson. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsmen present who try to save him, Wilson later dies from his wounds, leaving a deep impression on Kovic. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer , who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO. The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol in January 1968. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded and trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. The hospital living conditions are deplorable: rats crawl freely on the floors, the staff is generally apathetic to their patients\\' needs, doctors visit the patients infrequently, drug use is rampant , and equipment is too old and ill-maintained to be useful. He desperately tries to walk again with the use of crutches and braces, despite repeated warnings from his doctors. However, he soon suffers a bad fall that causes a compound fracture of his thighbone. The injury nearly robs him of his leg, and he vehemently argues with the doctors who briefly consider resorting to amputation. Ron returns home, permanently in a wheelchair, with his leg intact. From the start, he notices how all his family and friends treat him differently now that he is paralyzed. He begins to alienate his family and friends, complaining about students staging anti-war rallies across the country and burning the American flag. Though he tries to maintain his dignity as a Marine, Ron gradually becomes disillusioned, feeling the effects of his paralysis on his life, and realizes that all the things he was taught from birth, like honor, patriotism, and courage, were illusions which he would give up any day to get his legs back. In Ron\\'s absence, his younger brother Tommy has already become staunchly anti-war, remarking to Ron directly in his face what the war had done to him, leading to a rift between them. His highly religious mother also seems unable to deal with Ron\\'s new attitude as a resentful, paralyzed veteran. His problems are as much psychological as they are physical and he quickly becomes alcoholic and belligerent. During an Independence Day parade, he shows signs of post-traumatic stress when firecrackers explode and when a baby in the crowd starts crying. He reunites with his old high school friend, Timmy Burns, who is also a wounded veteran, and the two spend Ron\\'s birthday sharing war stories. Later, Ron goes to visit Donna at her college in Syracuse, New York. The two reminisce and she asks him to attend a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings. However, he cannot do so, because his chair prevents him from getting very far on campus because of curbs and stairways. He and Donna are separated after she and her fellow students are captured and taken away by the police at her college for demonstrating a protest against the Vietnam War. After returning home drunk one night after having a barroom confrontation with a World War II veteran who expresses no sympathy to Ron, Ron\\'s disillusionment grows severe enough that he has an intense fight with his mother, yelling at her that there was no God, and that they murdered civilians in Vietnam in disregard of Christian morals. Ron travels to a small town in Mexico  that seems to be a haven for paralyzed Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute he believes he\\'s in love with. Ron wants to ask her to marry him but when he sees her with another customer, the realization of real love versus a mere physical sexual experience sets in, and he decides against it. Hooking up with another wheelchair-using veteran, Charlie, who is furious over a prostitute\\'s mocking his lack of sexual function due to his paralysis, the two travel to what they believe will be a friendlier village. After annoying their taxicab driver, they end up stranded on the side of the road. They quarrel and fight about what each of them had really done in Vietnam, knocking each other out of their wheelchairs. Eventually, they are picked up by a man with a truck and eventually driven back to the \"Village of the Sun\". On his way back to Long Island, Ron makes a side trek to Georgia to visit the parents and family of Wilson, the Marine he accidentally killed during his tour. He tells them the real story about how their son died and confesses his guilt to them. Wilson\\'s widow, now the mother of the deceased Marine\\'s toddler son, admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive him for killing her husband, but adds that maybe God can. Wilson\\'s parents, however, are more forgiving and even sympathetic to his predicament and suffering, because Wilson\\'s father fought in the Pacific Theater during World War II and is disillusioned with the war in Vietnam. In spite of the mixed reactions he receives, the confession seems to lift a heavy weight from Ron\\'s conscience. Ron joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War  and travels to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami. He and his compatriots force their way into the convention hall during Richard Nixon\\'s acceptance speech and cause a commotion that makes it onto the national news. Ron himself tells a reporter about his negative experiences in Vietnam and the VA hospital conditions, that the Vietnam war is wrong, and tells him that the Vietnamese people are a proud people fighting against the US for their independence, fueling rage from the surrounding Nixon supporters. His interview is cut short when guards eject him and his fellow vets from the hall and attempt to turn them over to the police. They manage to break free from the police, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not so successfully this time. The film ends with Kovic\\'s speaking at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, shortly after the publication of his autobiography, Born on the Fourth of July.',\n",

              " 'When a battle between the Purple Dragons and what appear to be the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is captured on film, the Turtles are quick to refute their master Splinter\\'s accusations of carelessness. Breaking into the Purple Dragons\\' headquarters to get to the bottom of these mysterious doppelgängers, the Turtles discover that their \"impostors\" are, in fact, versions of them from another dimension. The other dimensional \"1987 Turtles\" prove to be too childish for the more serious-minded \"2003 Turtles\", but they are soon able to discern that they were teleported into their world in a dimensional portal accident that has also brought their arch-enemies, Shredder and Krang, and their battle fortress, the Technodrome, along with them. The eight Turtles head below the ground to track down the Technodrome, but their presence together only clues Shredder into the fact that there may be a version of himself on this world that he can ally with to take the Turtles down. The Technodrome escapes, and the Turtles, unable to track it, resolve to create a portal device of their own so they can travel to the \"1987 universe\" and obtain the gear the 1987 Turtles usually use to take the Technodrome down. While the Turtles are occupied with this task, Shredder uses the Technodrome\\'s technology to locate his dimensional counterpart, the Utrom known as Ch\\'rell, still in frozen exile on an ice asteroid after his final defeat by the 2003 Turtles. Ch\\'rell is teleported to the Technodrome, but upon recovering, immediately overthrows his bumbling other-self and seizes control of the fortress with the aid of his adopted daughter, Karai, who had been monitoring his movements and tracked him down after realizing he had escaped his frozen prison. Using Dimension X technology and Utrom science to create a new robotic exoskeleton for himself, Ch\\'rell dispatches his right-hand man Hun, who has been mutated into a monstrous mutant turtle himself after being doused with mutagen from the 1987 universe in the earlier battle, to track the Turtles down. With the aid of Bebop and Rocksteady, Hun finds and attacks the Turtles lair, but the eight reptiles complete their dimensional portal stick and escape to the 1987 universe. Unfortunately, Splinter is captured by Hun and brought before the Utrom Shredder to serve as bait in a trap. The 2003 Turtles meet the 1987 universe versions of April O\\'Neil and Splinter, and then return to the 2003 universe with the 1987 Turtles vehicles: the Party Wagon and Turtle Blimp. However, they discover that in their absence, the Utrom Shredder has fused the sciences of the Utroms and Dimension X and rebuilt the Technodrome as a truly terrifying war machine, filled with legions of improved robotic Foot Soldiers and mutated Purple Dragons. Entering the fortress to recover Splinter, the Turtles are defeated, and The Utrom Shredder then reveals his master plan: He has discovered while using 1987 Shredder\\'s to survey the multiverse in his plan to conquer it that there are not just the Turtles of the 1987 world and the 2003 world, but scores of them. Knowing that the turtles of those dimensions would stand in his way to conquer those worlds, 2003 Shredder decided to destroy them all by eliminating the original \"Prime\" universe. The Utrom Shredder scans the eight Turtles, each secured within an enormous spherical centrifuge-like device contained within the Technodrome, to locate the base similarities between them that will pinpoint the location of \"Turtle Prime\", and the brothers apparently do not survive the process. Once The Utrom Shredder has teleported the Technodrome away across the dimensions to Turtle Prime, however, the Turtles reappear, having been saved from oblivion by Karai, who has realized her father\\'s mad ambition would also spell their own destruction. With their world being erased around them as the Utrom Shredder\\'s plan goes into motion, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon headquarters again to appropriate some of the tech the criminals stole, in order to upgrade their dimensional portal stick and follow the Utrom Shredder to Turtle Prime. They\\'re attacked by Hun again, who\\'s still seeking revenge for his mutation. However, when he sees what\\'s happening to the world, Hun surrenders the tech just before he\\'s erased. The Turtles accomplish their task, and are whisked away to a grim and bleak monochrome realm from whence all Turtle realities sprang. They are attacked by the native 1984 \"Prime Turtles\", but they eventually manage to convince their ferocious progenitors to help them save all of creation. The twelve Turtles, with the aid of Splinter, Karai, and even the 1987 Shredder and Krang, engage the Utrom Shredder in battle, but he grows to massive height using molecular amplification technology from Dimension X and seems impervious to their attacks. When the Utrom Shredder is accidentally clipped by the energy beam from the Technodrome, however, his armor is damaged, and the Turtles all try to force him into the beam ... before it is abruptly cut off when Rocksteady trips over the power cable and unplugs it. The Utrom Shredder takes this opportunity to grab the 1984 Turtles and begins crushing them. The world begins to fade just as the 2003 world did, but The Utrom Shredder hesitates when he notices that he too is fading. Karai attempts to appeal to her father, telling him that what he\\'s trying to do will destroy them all, including him. But the Utrom Shredder has become too obsessed with revenge and decides he doesn\\'t care, and resumes his assault. At the last minute the 1987 Turtles throw explosive throwing stars at him, causing him to trip and drop the 1984 Turtles. The Utrom Shredder resumes his attack—until Bebop plugs the beam power cable back in and thus inadvertently obliterates the Utrom Shredder. With their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as their respective realities restore themselves. The 1987 characters take the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the 2003 characters use the portal stick to return to theirs. The 1984 Turtles decide to go get some pizza to eat ... as somewhere else, across time and space, Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman put the finishing touches on the first issue of Eastman and Laird\\'s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, expressing the hope that the book will sell.',\n",

Behind Ptolemy is a small table on which rests a scroll. We approach the scroll and see that it depicts a geocentric model of the universe. Paintings on the scroll morph into 3D representations of the sun, earth, and planets, which hover above the scroll and rotate within a complex system of crystalline spheres, illustrating the earth-centered model of the universe that persisted until the Renaissance. The flame from a lamp pans across the field of view and dissolves to a candle flame burning above the workshop table of Galileo Galilei in Italy around the year 1610. We move into a courtyard where Galileo is observing with his telescope. On an easel lit by a lantern we see his sketches of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. These drawings also morph into 3D objects to demonstrate how Galileo's observations transformed our perception of the planets and helped establish the Copernican model of the solar system. The film transports the audience through a series of environments, such as Mount Wilson Observatory in the early 1920s, when Edwin Hubble discovered the true nature of the Andromeda Galaxy and the expansion of the universe. Over the desk of an anonymous modern researcher we see a representation of the Big Bang. The device of transforming raw data, such as sketches and photographs, into 3D objects is used to suggest how scientists must apply imagination to interpret their observations. Towards the end of the show, the audience experiences a simulated flight through clusters of galaxies, into the Milky Way Galaxy, our solar system, skimming the surface of Mars, where the probable and tragic loss of oceans beckon the audience to wonder about the future of our planet, and then finally returns to Earth, landing on the front lawn of Griffith Observatory. The presenter once again appears with the glowing ball and delivers an epilogue, reminding the audience that Earth and everything on it, including its inhabitants, was made from the clouds of dust and gas that lace the Milky Way; we are stardust, and the universe is our home.\",\n",

              " 'Joseph, son of Israel  and Rachel, lived in the land of Canaan with eleven brothers and one sister. He was Rachel\\'s firstborn and Israel\\'s eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a \"long coat of many colors\".Another possible translation is \"coat with long sleeves\" - see \"A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature\", 1903. ISBN 1-932443-20-7 Israel\\'s favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph\\'s bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun , the moon  and eleven stars  bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph\\'s words concerning these dreams.  They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade. Judah, the strongest, thought twice about killing Joseph and proposed that he be sold. The traders paid twenty pieces of silver for Joseph, and the brothers took Joseph\\'s coat back to Jacob, who assumed Joseph had been killed by wild animals.  The text of the biblical story is muddled over who sold Joseph into slavery - which of the brothers, Reuben or Judah, and whether he was sold to Midianite traders or Ishmaelite traders. What is clear is that Joseph was sold to serve Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh\\'s guard.{{bibleverse}}, {{bibleverse}} While serving in Potiphar\\'s household, Yahweh was with Joseph so that he prospered in everything he did. Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar and so he became his personal servant. Then Joseph was promoted to oversee Potiphar\\'s entire household as a superintendent. After some time, Potiphar\\'s wife began to desire Joseph and sought to have an affair with him. Despite her persistence, he refused to have sex with her for fear of sinning against God. After some days of begging for him, she grabbed him by his cloak, but he escaped from her leaving his garment behind. Angered by his running away from her, she took his garment and made a false claim against him by charging that he tried have sex with her. This resulted in Joseph being thrown into prison.Josephus claims that Potiphar basically fell for his wife\\'s crocodile tears even though he couldn\\'t believe that Joseph was capable of \"making sport\" of his wife. - Josephus. The Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, 4.1-5   The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners,{{bibleverse}} and soon afterward Pharaoh\\'s chief cup bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison.{{bibleverse}} They both had dreams, and they asked Joseph to help interpret them. The chief cup bearer had held a vine in his hand, with three branches that brought forth grapes; he took them to Pharoah and put them in his cup. The chief baker had three baskets of bread on his head, intended for Pharoah, but some birds came along and ate the bread. Joseph told them that within three days the chief cup bearer would be reinstated but the chief baker would be hanged.{{bibleverse}} Joseph requested the cup bearer to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release from prison,{{bibleverse}} but the cup bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.{{bibleverse}} After Joseph was in prison for two more years, Pharaoh had two dreams which disturbed him. He dreamt of seven lean cows which rose out of the river and devoured seven fat cows; and, of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. Pharaoh\\'s wise men were unable to interpret these dreams, but the chief cup bearer remembered Joseph and spoke of his skill to Pharaoh. Joseph was called for, and interpreted the dreams as foretelling that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine, and advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations \"from all over the earth\" came to Egypt to buy bread as this nation was the only Kingdom prepared for the seven year drought.  In the second year of famine,{{bibleverse}} Joseph\\'s half brothers were sent to Egypt, by their father Israel, to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him to be their brother Joseph. However, Joseph did recognize them and did not receive them kindly, rather he disguised himself and spoke to them in the Egyptian language using an interpreter. He did not speak at all to them in his native tongue, Hebrew.{{bibleverse}} After questioning them as to where they came from, he accused them of being spies. They pleaded with him that their only purpose was to buy grain for their family in the land of Canaan. After they mentioned that they had left a younger brother at home, the Vizier  demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This brother was Joseph\\'s blood brother, Benjamin. He placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. Joseph sent the brothers back with food but kept one brother, and the remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men.After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah\\'s persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution.Upon their return to Egypt, the brothers were afraid because of the returned money in their money sacks. Then when they get there Joseph reveals to them that he is in fact their brother, Joseph. Then has their father Jacob brought so they are all reunited in Egypt',\n",

              " ' The film begins with a battered, dirty, and injured Morgaine riding in a small boat through a misty river. Most of the film is a reflection through her eyes, with Morgaine as narrator. In the beginning of the film, the Saxons are attempting to brutally invade Britain. It is noted that a strong king is needed to unite Pagans and Christians and defeat the Saxons before Avalon and Britain are lost. Morgaine is eight, living with her pagan mother Igraine and Christian father Gorlois. Igraine\\'s little sister, Morgause, lives with them too. One day, her oldest sister, Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, along with Merlin, comes to Igraine with a prophecy that she will bear the Pagan/Christian king who is destined to best the Saxons. Igraine is distressed after hearing that the child will not be Gorlois\\', and she refuses to bear the heir. Merlin expresses that the father of the great king would be wearing a dragon on his arm. Igraine doesn\\'t listen. Suddenly, little Morgaine has a vision, seeing her father dead. Viviane is pleased but concerned that Morgaine has \"the Sight.\" Soon, Igraine and Gorlois, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, are invited to a feast with the High King, who has called the feast to name his successor. In storms Uther Pendragon, a dashing and rugged man. Igraine is immediately drawn to him, and therefore Gorlois soon antagonizes Uther. However, as soon as Igraine sees Uther extend his arm, revealing the dragon of the prophecy, Igraine is flustered and leaves. Uther pursues her outside, where she is cold and unfeeling, trying to avoid any feelings. Uther expresses that he, as a Pagan, knew something bonded them before they even met. Gorlois interrupts the meeting, announcing out of jealousy that Uther was named the High King\\'s successor. Later, after Uther is crowned, Gorlois sets his army up outside of Uther\\'s camp to kill Uther. Viviane sends Igraine a vision and tells her she can still save Uther; Igraine sends her soul out to Uther and warns him just in time for his men to evacuate. A battle between Gorlois and Uther ensues, and Igraine faints. The next day, Morgaine sees her mother feverish and ill, and her aunt Morgause sends Morgaine to pick some herbs despite the manor being on lockdown on orders from Gorlois to protect Igraine and Morgaine. She is caught, but is released after a man in armor and Merlin approach the gates. A guard asks to see the masked man\\'s face, and Merlin puts a charm on the man to make him appear as Gorlois. At first, Morgaine is thankful her father is alive, but she noticed the dragon of the man\\'s arm and begins to understand that her \"father\" is Uther. Later, she is waiting for her father\\'s body to come home. Morgause says that \"Gorlois\" is upstairs sleeping with Igraine, but Morgaine tells Morgause that her father is dead. Gorlois\\' corpse then arrives, and Igraine is shell shocked. Uther emerges in his true form. Morgause, however, ignores the drama, as the man who delivered Gorlois\\' body, King Lot of Orkney, takes notice of her, and she falls in love. Uther takes Morgaine and Igraine to Camelot, where Igraine gives birth to Arthur Pendragon, the grand new heir of the prophecy.  Arthur and Morgaine grow up loving each other dearly. When Arthur is five and Morgaine is 13, Viviane and Merlin return, saying that it is time to take Arthur away for his training with Merlin as future king. Viviane then orders Morgaine to come with her to Avalon to be trained as a priestess. Igraine and Uther do not want Morgaine to go, but Viviane threatens to withdraw Avalon\\'s support of Uther, and Morgaine and Arthur are taken away from Camelot. Arthur and Morgaine are torn apart tearfully from each other, Arthur heading north with Merlin, and Morgaine heading south with Viviane. Viviane then takes Morgaine behind a misty curtain into a utopian island, Avalon. Viviane trains Morgaine to gain power of the elements, and in the servitiude of the Mother Goddess. It takes ten years for Morgaine to be initiated, her final test being to part the mists. Igraine has a distressful vision of Morgaine \"being taken.\" Soon after her initiation, Morgaine meets her cousin Lancelot , a handsome and bold warrior. He has come to seek his mother\\'s blessing in battle, but she is reluctant to give it. Morgaine shows him a stone circle, and she begins to fall in love with him. Lancelot sees through the misty veil a few Christian nuns and some virgin postulants walking down a path. One of them strays and seems as if she is aware of Avalon\\'s existence. Lancelot begs Morgaine to open the mists for her, and she does so. The postulant is startled, but quickly smitten with Lancelot, as Lancelot is with her. The girl\\'s name is Gwenhwyfar, daughter of a Welsh king. Morgaine immediately dislikes Gwenhwyfar, and closes the mists on her, separating them. Lancelot, annoyed, decides to defy his mother and leaves. A few days later, on Beltane, Viviane sends Morgaine to be a part of a fertility rite as \"The Virgin Huntress\", where Morgaine is to make love to the man who kills the king\\'s stag. Both partners are masked, so neither knows who the other is, but afterward, Morgaine longs for it to be Lancelot, but she knows she will never know for sure.  Arthur having completed his training with Merlin, finds his father, Uther, in a Saxon battle just before he dies. He is locked in a burning church and calls to both God and Goddess for help. Viviane, on behalf of the Goddess, answers, and gives Arthur Excalibur in exchange for loyalty to Avalon and paganism as well as Christianity. Arthur quickly agrees, and defeats the Saxons. Morgaine is finally released from Avalon and returns to Camelot for her brother\\'s coronation. She reunites first with Morgause, who is now Queen of Orkney and has a teenage son, Gawain. She then finds her mother, old and worn, sitting by a window with the Bishop Patrick. Igraine says that she is becoming a Christian nun and moving to Glastonbury. She says that she wants to seek repentance for betraying Gorlois long ago and being twice widowed. Morgaine is startled by this news and distressed. Meanwhile, Arthur has been given a Christian Princess as his bride. As Arthur introduces his bride to Lancelot, she is revealed to be Gwenhwyfar. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar are bewildered by this twist of fate, and have an awkward first meeting. Arthur then happily reunites with Morgaine. But soon, Arthur naively reveals that he was the King\\'s Stag at the Beltane feast. Morgaine, shocked that she\\'d made passionate love to her own brother, cries in despair and shame. In a brief scene, Morgause is seen performing an infertility curse on Gwenhwyfar, a woman \"she has decided to hate,\" cursing her to barrenness. Arthur is crowned king under the both Pendragon and Christian banners. The Bishop Patrick then weds him to Gwenhwyfar. Merlin and Viviane appear startled, this union seemingly unexpected even to them. Morgause whispers to her husband that Gwenhwyfar will never have children, making her son Gawain next in line to the throne. Morgaine feels sick and quickly leaves the celebration. Morgause follows her; Morgaine reveals that she is pregnant but does not mention that Arthur is the father. Morgause is surprised—Morgaine\\'s baby would inherit the crown before Gawain. Arthur is called away soon after his coronation, leaving Gwenhwyfar in Lancelot\\'s care. They go riding one day, only to be attacked by Saxons. Lancelot saves Gwenhwyfar from being raped, and they hide. Gwenhwyfar and Lancelot kiss, but vow that their loyalties are to Arthur first, not each other, and they swear to never have an affair.  Morgause concocts a potion to help Morgaine abort her pregnancy. Viviane stops Morgaine before she can drink it. Morgause warns Morgaine to never be Viviane\\'s pawn. Morgaine is furious with Viviane for letting this abomination happen: a bastard child fathered by her own brother. Viviane wants this baby to be Arthur\\'s heir, whose pagan roots would make him the greatest ruler Britain has ever seen. Morgaine renounces Viviane and Avalon, and moves to Orkney with Morgause. In the middle of winter, Morgaine gives birth to a son, Mordred. Morgause is advised by her husband, Lot, to kill the child. Indeed, Morgause has ample opportunity to kill him, as Morgaine is unconscious due to a fever she develops after childbirth. She sets Mordred in front of a cold open window. Morgaine suddenly calls out in her fever that Arthur is the father. Morgause gets a new idea and saves the baby and takes him to be nursed. She tells her husband that she will tutor and raise Mordred so the boy will have her influence. She even nurses Mordred for the first time herself.  This begins the second part of the miniseries. Morgaine, convinced by Morgause, decides to return to Camelot. Arthur has become the great king everyone has hoped for, and Gwenhwyfar is beginning to grow distressed at her inability to produce the son Arthur needs to succeed him. Arthur assures Gwenhwyfar that they are still young and have years to bear children. Morgaine returns to Camelot and is greeted by Arthur. She is introduced to Sir Accolon, a pagan Knight of the Round Table and son of the elderly pagan King Uriens of North Wales. Accolon and Morgaine are drawn to each other. Meanwhile, Lancelot is dealing with increased stress over Gwenhwyfar and his growing desire for her. Gwenhwyfar, obsessed with bearing children, resorts to asking Morgaine for a fertility charm. Morgaine obliges, and gives her the charm on the night of Beltane. On the night of Beltane, at a feast, Arthur gets very drunk. Meanwhile, Morgaine, feeling insulted by Arthur\\'s lewd remarks towards paganism, leaves the feast and rides out towards the field where the pagans light the Beltane fires and dance. Accolon follows her outside. Arthur, in the meantime, is taken to bed, barely awake, by a spirited Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar. Arthur then brings up how he notices Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar looking at each other, and how Gwenhwyfar has no child. Arthur, blaming the lack of an heir on himself, suggests that Gwenhwyfar sleep with both him and Lancelot in the hopes of conceiving the needed heir. Arthur emphasizes that Gwenhwyfar will be able to swear that the child was conceived in the king\\'s bed. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar are both skeptical, but Arthur persuades them, and they all bed down together. Meanwhile, Morgaine and Accolon kiss amongst the dancing pagans. The next day, Lancelot is feeling regret for what he has done with Gwenhwyfar and Arthur. Morgaine realizes that Lancelot will never love her, so she devises an alternative to Lancelot feeling regret and sadness all his life. Gwenhwyfar has, by this time, gotten her period, and therefore still remains barren. Her serving woman, Elaine, is ecstatic, as Lancelot  has asked her to marry him . Gwenhwyfar, angered and distressed, dismisses her. Gwenhwyfar is also annoyed at Morgaine, who promised the charm would work, and resents Arthur for insisting the threesome would work. At Lancelot and Elaine\\'s wedding, Morgaine speaks with Merlin. Viviane is absent from her son\\'s wedding, as the pagan banners of Pendragon have been taken down from Camelot due to Gwenhwyfar being hysterically upset with the \"painted savages.\" Meanwhile, King Uriens discusses taking a second wife  with Arthur, and out of spite, Gwenhwyfar suggests Morgaine. Arthur isn\\'t too keen on the idea, but he and Gwenhwyfar ask Morgaine. Gwenhwyfar carefully words the proposal, and Morgaine thinks it is Accolon proposing, and accepts. She only finds out too late that she was engaged to the father, and not the son. Morgaine decides that it would be for the best to go through with the marriage, as Wales was an important political ally. Merlin, upset by Morgaine leaving Camelot with Uriens, leaves the feast.  Merlin, upon returning to Avalon, dies of old age and tiredness, with Viviane horribly upset, and Avalon filling with mist. Morgaine, ironically, finds her marriage to Uriens to be the few happy years her life would bring her. Accolon becomes like a son to her, and for the first time in her life, she feels like part of a family. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Mordred, Morgaine\\'s son by Arthur, has grown to manhood. Viviane comes to him and tells him of his being next in line for the throne. Mordred takes this to heart and tells Morgause  he is going to claim his birthright. When he arrives in Camelot, Arthur is planning to turn back the Saxons, who have come on Britain again in force. Mordred makes himself known to Arthur only as his nephew, his mother being Morgaine. Arthur is not told Mordred is his son, and Mordred is welcomed with open arms into Camelot. King Uriens dies, and Morgaine decides to go back to Avalon. However, the mists will not open for her, and Morgaine believes the Goddess is dying. In despair, she crouches in the boat and lets herself float, only to be found by Igraine, still alive and living among the nuns. The women have a brief but happy reunion. Mordred and Arthur, overlooking the knights one day, begin a discussion about the next heir. Mordred insists Arthur should name someone, but Arthur still believes Gwenhwyfar might still bear a son. Mordred insists he choose someone before Arthur dies in battle. Arthur says he needs someone of his own descent. It is here that Mordred reveals himself as Arthur\\'s son and that Morgaine was the Virgin Huntress from long ago. Gwenhwyfar overhears this and runs away, embarrassed and despaired.  Gwenhwyfar has fallen frantically into praying all day before her dozens of religious icons. One day Lancelot meets her there, and they plan a secret rendezvous, only to have Mordred overhear. Mordred catches the pair before they sleep together, and he threatens to take both of them before the king and have them hanged for infidelity. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar escape, and they part for the last time. Gwenhwyfar enters Glastonbury, where Igraine meets her. Igraine takes her to Morgaine, still living there, and both women finally make amends with each other. Morgaine goes back to Camelot, now in ruins, with various men crucified, hanged and decapitated along the walls of the palace. Mordred, Morgaine, Viviane, and Morgause all meet on the stairs to the palace. Viviane reveals Morgause\\'s evil for all to see, reminding the people of the true ways of the Goddess; Morgause, in anger, takes a knife to kill Viviane, but Viviane quickly catches the knife and in turn, stabs Morgause first. Morgause falls dead. Mordred, having thought of Morgause as his real mother, takes his sword and kills Viviane. Because Viviane was Lady of the Lake, the sun is eclipsed, and Igraine senses her sisters are dead. Raven, a priestess who had taken a vow of silence, screams vocally for the first time in despair. A final battle then is set to take place between the Saxons and Arthur\\'s army. Lancelot joins him at the front lines just before the battle. Morgaine is off seeing over the cremation of Viviane and Morgause. Mordred has actually joined the Saxons and is leading them to Arthur. Morgaine sees this in a vision as the bodies of her aunts burn before her, and rides off to the battlefield. The fierce battle kills all until only Mordred and Arthur stand. Morgaine arrives all too late. She sees the bodies of Gawain, Accolon, and Lancelot among the thousands. Mordred and Arthur have both fatally wounded each other. Mordred dies first, in Morgaine\\'s arms, but Arthur lingers. Arthur begs Morgaine to take him to Avalon.  As in the beginning, Morgaine is in the boat. Arthur, barely alive, is lying in front of her; Morgaine tries to part the mists, but fails. Arthur holds out Excalibur, suggesting the Goddess needs an offering. Morgaine hurls the sword into the mist, where it is mystically transformed into a cross, and temporarily opens up the mists to Avalon. Arthur sees Avalon, and Morgaine declares, \"We\\'re home!\" Arthur sees the beautiful land, and then dies. As Arthur dies, the mists close permanently. Morgaine then goes to Glastonbury &mdash; not to live as a nun, but because she has nowhere else to go. She is convinced the Goddess is dead, until one day she sees a little girl praying at the feet of the Virgin Mary. Morgaine smiles, believing that the Goddess isn\\'t dead, but rather has reincarnated herself in the form of Mary, and perhaps there is hope to one day, generations later, bring Avalon back.',\n",

Sam, much changed by his re-engagement with his father, inherits the house he finished building, but in the closing scenes he decides to give the property to the girl who had been injured in a car crash that George\\'s father had been the cause of, who was living in a trailer park, rather than occupying it himself or selling it for profit. Over a voice-over, George says his final words to Sam: \"I always thought of myself as a house. I was always what I lived in. It didn\\'t need to be big; it didn\\'t even need to be beautiful; it just needed to be mine. I became what I was meant to be. I built myself a life... I built myself a house. Twenty-nine years ago, my father crossed a double line. Changed my life and the life of a little girl forever with that mistake. I can\\'t stop thinking about her. With every crash of every wave, I hear something now. I never listened before. I\\'m on the edge of a cliff, listening. Almost finished. If you were a house , Sam, this is where you would want to be built: on rock, facing the sea. Listening. Listening.\"',\n",

              " 'The story begins with its focus on a group of hunters illegally hunting game out in the woods. Originally thought to be dead, the hunter\\'s target springs back to life and flees into the heavy brush and trees. Determined not to let the game suffer, one of the hunters decides to pursue the elk in its fleet. After some amount of exploration he finds his elk...hanging over a branch, shot by an arrow. Hearing noises he turns around to an arrow shot at him and screams. Kerra and Brock are introduced to the story line at their mother\\'s funeral. With their father having apparently disappeared for some unknown reason years ago, their mother recently dying, and no other known relatives within the area, the two are set to become wards of the state. In an effort to keep the two together, Kerra decides that they must pack up their belongings and escape before the return of the social worker assigned to their case. Brock, having prior association with a local gang and a criminal record, assists his sister in stealing the social worker\\'s vehicle. The two drive off in a fury in an effort to escape. Remembering a relative from early on in her childhood, Kerra plots a course for Leeds, Utah, a small LDS rich community in the southern part of the state. Arriving at their aunt and uncle\\'s house, the two concoct a story indicating that they are traveling across the country to meet up with their mother who had recently acquired a new place of employment. With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed. Shortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days. These stories recall \"strange noises\" in the woods behind their house and dealings with an \"imaginary\" being whom Kerra had termed to be \"Kid Donni.\" One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew. Following the quake, Kerra is reunited with her \"imaginary\" childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon. The earthquake is revealed to have caused a \"rift\" in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world. As the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and Gadianton armiesto exit the past near the Whitman\\'s home. Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies. It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from \"modern\" times named Chris. Meanwhile, during their escape from California, Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area, which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs. Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag, the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag. Near the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large. The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies. Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier. A major Nephite-Gadianton battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding. Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored. Kerra is heartbroken at not getting to say goodbye to her Nephite friend, but both families are happy that they were kept safe and that father and children were reunited again.',\n",

              " \"Sultan Mahmud Shah, ruler of Malacca, dreams of a woman with unnatural beauty. Plagued by the dream, he asks the court magician their meaning. The court magician tells him that his dream is that of an extraordinary princess who lives on the peak of Mount Ledang. Sultan Mahmud becomes obsessed with the Puteri, and orders his Bendahara to cancel his scheduled wedding to a local princess. Sultan Mahmud’s officers and Dinda, the princess he had been engaged to, are confused with the Sultan’s sudden change of attitude. Dinda’s brother, Laksamana Zainol, is especially angry on his sister’s behalf. Zainol, propelled by his sister’s betrayal, begins talking to the Malaccan people of Sultan Mahmud’s foolishness, planting the seeds of rebellion. Sultan Mahmud commands the Bendahara to seek the Puteri of Gunung Ledang out, but he claims the task to be impossible. The elderly Hang Tuah, greatest of all Malaccan warriors, offers to find the princess for the Sultan. He forms a party of warriors and they set out to Mount Ledang to find her and present the Sultan’s proposal of marriage. They travel a great distance and have to overcome many obstacles. Hang Tuah himself becomes injured and is too weak to reach the peak, so he sends the younger members of the group onward without him. A single young warrior named Tun Mamat survives to reach the peak, where he is tempted by a flower fairy who tries to seduce him off his path. Tun Mamat repeatedly spurns the flower fairy and, upon beating her test, meets an elderly hag or Nenek Kebayan who agrees to help lead him to the peak of Mount Ledang. Once at the peak, the Nenek Kebayan leaves Tun Mamat, and he is greeted by four more flower fairies. They give him one final warning and then leave, making way for the Puteri herself to appear. The Puteri tells Tun Mamat that she has no desire to be queen, but she will marry Sultan Mahmud if he can give her seven presents as her dowry. Tun Mamat descends the mountain with the message, along the way reuniting with various members of the group who were lost or left behind on the way, including the recovering Hang Tuah. When Tun Mamat repeats the Puteri's message to him, Hang Tuah realises that the conditions are a rejection and he has failed in his task to the Sultan. He decides to leave Malacca forever in self-imposed exile. Tun Mamat and the rest of the warriors return to Malacca where the seven conditions are presented to Sultan Mahmud and the royal court, which are: * A golden bridge from the peak of Mount Ledang to the Malaccan palace, * A silver bridge from the Malaccan palace to the peak of Mount Ledang, * Seven trays of mosquitoes' hearts, * Seven trays of germs, * Seven jars of betel nut juice, * Seven jars of virgin's tears, * A bowl of Sultan Mahmud's son's blood. At hearing the conditions the royal court is in shock and dismay, but Sultan Mahmud is so focused on the beauty of the Puteri that he proudly claims that the seven conditions are easy and commands his people to fulfill them. All the gold and silver of the kingdom is taken from the Malaccan people to build the bridges; mosquitoes and germs are allowed to thrive, causing sickness throughout the land; all virgin women are forced to cry into bowls to collect their tears. At this time Zainol holds more secret meetings with the discontented people of Malacca to discuss Sultan Mahmud's inhumane commands. The people, now confident and angry, decide to strike at Sultan Mahmud for his injustice. During a second collection of gold and silver, a discontented man stands up to the royal collection officer and a fight ensues between the soldiers and the Malaccan commoners. This triggers more fights and skirmishes, sending the entire kingdom into turmoil. At long last six of the seven conditions are fulfilled. Sultan Mahmud is overjoyed but is cut short when the Bendahara reminds him that the seventh condition has not been done. Sultan Mahmud visits the sleeping chambers of his son, Tengku Ahmad, to strike him down with a keris but two nights in a row he is unable to go through with it. On the third night, Sultan Mahmud is ready to kill his son for good, but at the last minute throws his keris aside. Then the Puteri herself appears and says that she will never marry him because he is a cruel man. Sultan Mahmud realises the error of his ways and begs his son for forgiveness. The next morning Zainol and a large group of Malaccan people attack the palace. Sultan Mahmud decides to face them openly where he confesses his crimes and puts his life in their hands. All the people, including Zainol, accept his apology and pledge allegiance to him once again.\",\n",

While walking around Chico stumbles upon Rita and her gentleman-friend almost initiating a fight but the Maitre d' overhears that Chico is an accomplished pianist and takes him backstage, since the main event of the evening is missing the pianist and he fills in playing at first sight a new piece by Igor Stravinsky. Chico, initially nervous, ends up performing the piece with aplomb, to the delight of the band. Rita finally agrees to flee with Chico in Ramón’s motorcycle along with the Americans, ditching her own John. After a dangerous chase, the American man finally crashes into a car dealership, giving the others plenty of time to escape. Rita and Chico take their leave from the rest of their party and go to a bar where Chico introduces her to bebop music, which she takes up very quickly; afterwards they go to Chico’s place and spend the rest of the night together. The next day Rita wakes up to find Chico playing a new composition on the piano, which he names “Rita”. As they play and kiss, Juana, Chico’s former girlfriend walks in and ends up in a fight with Rita after which both women leave angrily. Chico is taken with Rita and does not want to play in an upcoming contest if it not with Rita, so Ramón, who also is his agent, tracks Rita down and pays her to participate in the contest. After the performance is over, Rita leaves and Chico follows her in Ramón’s motorcycle. He sees that she enters a house where he believes that she lives with a man, but as it turns out it is the house of a santera that had predicted she would cause him much suffering. That night the contest winners are announced, and Pico and Chico win. The prize is a month’s engagement at the Hotel Nacional. A few weeks later, Chico and Rita are having great success during their performances and Rita’s beauty mesmerizes more than one man, which ignites Chico’s jealousy. One of the admirers, Ron, asks Rita to his table to discuss business. He offers to take Rita to New York City to make her a star, where jazz and Latin music are a burgeoning scene.

The students are sent via boats onto the dangerous island base of the Wild Seven, and a number of them are killed when they were bombed, shot or their collar detonated during the journey onto the island, leaving only a cluster alive. Most notably, two of the survivors are the main protagonist Takuma Aoi, and Shiori Kitano, the daughter of Kitano, the \"teacher\" from the first film who died after being shot by Shuya. Taken into the Wild Seven\\'s base, the surviving students\\' explosive collars are removed and they are encouraged to help the members of the Wild Seven stop the Battle Royale for good. While most of the survivors agree, Takuma and in particular Shiori remain unconvinced. Shuya sends a video message to the world of their goal to live free. In response to the video and pressure from the U.S. government, the Japanese prime minister takes command of the military present at the Battle Royale headquarters and orders an attack on the island base, with no survivors allowed. Takeuchi is enraged, and is discovered to have the same type of collar on his neck as the students. On Christmas Day, the war between the Wild Seven and the military occurs, with numerous casualties on both sides. Survivors of the base retreat to the mainland via a mine shaft, leaving Shuya, Takuma and Shiori as the only remaining fighters. Takeuchi appears in a rugby uniform, and after a brief and personal exchange, Takeuchi allows the group to flee as he sacrifices himself. Shiori is shot and dies in Shuya\\'s arms, seemingly forgiving him for his past crimes. Shuya and Takuma run out to kill the rest of the soldiers. Several months later, Shuya and Takuma rejoin the other survivors, including Noriko Nakagawa, in what appears to be Pakistan or Afghanistan. They have regrouped as friends, and what lies next for them remains open.',\n",

Transferred to a minimum security hospital to seek treatment for bulimia, White Girl teams up with Angela \"Cyclona\" Garcia, a teenage serial killer. Together, they escape from the hospital, despite White Girl injuring herself on a barbed-wire fence. Cyclona is convinced her beloved Sister Gomez can help \"White Girl\" with her eating disorder and they head to Tijuana. On the way, Cyclona murders a family and has sex with the dead bodies. \"White Girl\" is not happy that Cyclona has stopped taking her meds and insists she continue to take occasional doses should they continue together. They steal the family\\'s car and make their way south. On the way, Cyclona reveals how Sister Gomez saved her from being molested by her father and possibly aliens. After drinking one too many beers and huffing some paint, they crash and fall down a hill laughing. Undaunted, the two fugitives catch a ride on a freight train only to be assaulted by a transient crack addict. Cyclona kills him to protect White Girl, and the two make off with his bag of crack and guns. Venturing into the woods, they leave a trail of crack which is picked away by shady men with crow feathers on their hats. Lost and confused, they make it to the border only to have a stand-off with two customs officials, both of whom Cyclona kills. \"White Girl\" violently pistol-whips Cyclona and after making her point, the two race to the suburbs of Tijuana. In Tijuana, Crystal/White Girl makes money by luring men to dark alleys on the promise of a good time, and mugging them. Cyclona and White Girl check into a run-down motel where they have a moment with beer, a shower, a vibrating bed, and some rampant lesbian sex as White Girl finally gives into Cyclona\\'s sexual advances. After a few days, they find a poster that shows Sister Gomez is in town. Sister Gomez appears to be a Catholic/spiritualist healer; Cyclona is very keen that they visit her, for Sister Gomez has protected her from abuse in the past, and might be able to help them. They visit Sister Gomez at her gaudy mission house. Sister makes an enormous roast feast for her \"little movie star\"  and the friend \"with the hungry demon\" , referring to her bulimia. Cyclona then disappears as White Girl is forced to work for Sister Gomez in the same way as she has been doing, in exchange for food. Finally, Crystal grows weary and makes her way to the basement, where she finds small children in a bondage room with a U.F.O shaped lantern. There is blood everywhere. Cyclona is hanging half-nude in a bondage style contraption. She tells Crystal that Sister Gomez made her watch while she chopped up children and made food out of them. She reveals that her ultimate plan for Crystal was to fatten her up with the meat of the children, and then, serve Crystal up for dinner as well. Crystal concludes that Sister Gomez is the witch-leader of a bizarre cult that rapes and eats children and then sells the child porn videos, protected by the front of a Catholic mission. Ready to deliver justice, White Girl/Crystal frees Cyclona and kills all the cult members; she also reveals Sister Gomez to be a rather well-endowed man. Not succumbing to bullets, Gomez is thrown in the oven. Burning, Gomez screams of his 100,000 years of terror and the revenge from his father Jupiter that will ensue. Crystal, keeping a promise made earlier, is forced to kill Cyclona in a tearful scene rather than allow her to be captured. Cyclona, wishing to leave behind a life of abuse and violence, hopes to be reincarnated as an eagle . White Girl makes a deal with the federales and leaves with her lawyer/pimp, stating \"I\\'m not hungry anymore.\"',\n",
              " 'The film\\'s main character is Byeong-gu, a man who believes that aliens are about to attack Earth and that he is the only one who can prevent them. With his childlike circus-performer girlfriend, he kidnaps a powerful executive whom he believes to be a top ranking extraterrestrial who can contact the prince of these aliens during the upcoming eclipse. After imprisoning the man in his basement workshop, he proceeds to torture the executive and slowly Byeong-gu\\'s true intentions are revealed. It seems that the executives company poisoned his mother in a pharmacy test, and though Byeong-gu does seem to believe that the executive is an alien, he\\'s deluding himself to his obvious act of revenge. When a detective comes calling to investigate the disappearance, the executive tries to escape but is thwarted by the psychotic Byeong-gu. The detective at first finds nothing unusual but on his way out sees Byeong-gu\\'s dog  gnawing on the bones of his master\\'s past victims. After contacting a partner in the police force he is killed by the psycho\\'s bees, is hacked up and fed to the dog. Byeong-gu then crucifies the executive and breaks his leg with his axe butt, to punish him for his attempted escape. In a desperate move, the executive convinces Byeong-gu that the bottle of benzene in his trunk is the antidote for his comatose mother. As Byeong-gu races to the hospital to deliver the antidote, the executive frees himself by pulling his hands through the nails. He then travels deeper into his captor’s lair, finding evidence of his grim research. Photos of mutilated corpses are littered with blood scrawled notebooks, while hands and brains of past ‘subjects’ reside in jars. Reading through the journals the executive discovers Byeong-gu\\'s traumatic past: his father was a coal miner who lost one of his arms due to his dangerous work and was killed by his wife when he attempted to attack her and his son. He was beaten in school and was a victim to the sadistic whims of his cruel teachers. He showed early signs of violence, such as stabbing a fellow school mate with a kitchen knife. His mother was then poisoned in the aforementioned incident and at a protest, his former girlfriend was beaten to death. He slowly went mad from the violence that surrounded him. At the same moment, the dead detective\\'s partner arrives and finds the frantic executive as Byeong-gu, after desperately rushing to the hospital, feeds the so-called antidote to his comatose mother, inadvertently killing her. Infuriated, he returns home with intention of killing the executive but finds the detective there. After a brief struggle and a bizarre turn of events, he captures both of them and plans on killing them both. The frantic executive then admits to being an alien and proceeds to spin an exotic tale which stretches back to the time of the dinosaurs, about how his race was trying to save humanity by experimenting on the genetic code of his mother. He also agrees to contact the alien prince at the executive\\'s company factory. Byeong-gu leaves the detective all his notes, saying that if he does not make it, he will have the responsibility of saving the planet. At the factory, the executive triggers a computer controlled robotic arm to kill Byeong-gu\\'s girlfriend, and after a long struggle, he beats his captor near to death. When the police arrive, they shoot Byeong-gu, and as he bleeds to death he wonders aloud, \"Now who will save the earth?\" In the end aliens do arrive and take the executive, who is in fact the alien prince himself, aboard their ship. After failing his mission, he deems Earth a failed experiment and blasts it from creation. As the credits roll a video recaps the entire journey of Byeong-gu\\'s life.',\n",

              " 'A sequel in name only to a 2004 film , this film is about a teacher, named Aajaan Panor , who is humiliated by some students. She turns to black magic to exact revenge. The film begins with a man in a fishing boat, accidentally stabbing his finger on a fish hook. He is taken to see a mystic, who claims that the man is the victim of a Cambodian curse. He is tied to a chair and fish hooks start to emerge from under his skin as he screams. In sepia-toned flashbacks, we learn the story of six school chums who have a grudge: Ta, Kim, Por, Tair, Noot, and Ko. Ta\\'s mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta\\'s teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend . The boyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers , and Ko is their fun-loving friend. During their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por . Por subsequently discovers he\\'s not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta\\'s father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach . Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to \\'prove her infidelity\\' to Ta\\'s father. The six friends do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them. Seeking revenge, the students approach a monk who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the monk and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies via fish hook. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city. The story proper begins two years after these events. The six friends gather together after Ta\\'s father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor\\'s cottage on the river, Noot\\'s cell phone rings; her secret boyfriend wants to meet, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess , and Ta\\'s great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. Miss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents. At dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, Por spits up a fingernail. The group realises that the meat in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and eating the monk who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whomever is holding the camera. Tair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta\\'s father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta\\'s father, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can\\'t leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta\\'s father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangos. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta\\'s dead father. The group runs to the house\\'s dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of salamanders claw their way out of his body, killing him. The youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair  still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. She seems to see Kim as a walking corpse, and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes. Por finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. He fires the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por\\'s confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle. Miss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch. In the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot\\'s bag. Her cell phone rings—it\\'s her boyfriend, wondering where she is. In the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por\\'s head, the officers break in and shoot her. Kim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim\\'s room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta\\'s charred corpse. In horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly-burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim\\'s hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the monk was taken by Ta\\'s father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta\\'s great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta\\'s great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the monk that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane . It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta\\'s vengeful spirit had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her. A flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn\\'t court Kim within a week, she will \"offer\" Ta to her. Kim was then seen with the monk who appeared earlier, who warns her, \"Once you start, it will follow you till you die.\" She receives a clay doll and thanks the monk. Kim jumps out of the hospital window to her death, holding the clay doll. Ta\\'s burnt form lays beside her declaring his love for her.',\n",

Lorena arrives at the house and meets the priest, while Louette stands by the gravediggers who are about to bury Pauline, since her funeral ended an hour ago. As she stands watching, a raven drops the voodoo symbol of death, a string of beads tied at the end with feathers, onto the coffin in the ground. As Louette watches in horror, the beads start to bleed and then burst into flame, burning through the coffin, and causing thick smoke to fill the air, and Louette hurriedly tells the gravediggers to bury the coffin. Lorena finds out that Pauline has died, and has entitled her as part of the will, which wasn't mentioned in the letter. Thomas takes her things inside, and Lorena finds that Phillipe has arrived and is her cousin, and confronts him. She finds out that he is a horny, annoying twenty year old, and befriends him, despite his flaws and personality. Louette tells Thomas what she saw, and that she is scared, and Thomas just tells her it's her imagination, as she goes to take Lorena and Phillipe to their rooms. While doing this, Phillipe discovers Pauline's old elevator, and finds that it doesn't work. Meanwhile, another relative, Harriet Johnson is aboard a plane heading to the town, and sees a figure in a hooded robe, staring at her, and screams only to have it disappear and the other passengers give her weird looks. She finally arrives at the house, during the night, while it's storming. She is introduced to everyone, who are about to eat supper. The will reader arrives, but finds that he can't read it, for not all four of them are there, and says he will be back in one week. The three relatives then begin to discuss with Thomas why they're the only ones there. Thomas tells them that they never met Pauline, so she wanted them to come, and then describes why there is voodoo related material around the house, as Louette watches from behind a door. They are interrupted by a white, drenched man: the fourth relative, Dr. Andrew Cunninham. They introduce themselves, and Phillipe begins to call him out for being the only white relative, before they go and eat supper. After, Philippe begins to look around, and is scared by Thomas who is walking around the house. Philippe tells him he doesn't believe in voodoo and picks up a feathered bead, throwing it in Thomas' face, then going to get drunk. Lorena is inside her room, when a skull appears in her mirror, then her windows spring open and a robed skeleton appears, making her scream and run out into the hallway. She meets a drunken Philippe, who tries to kiss her, only to be sent away by Andrew, who comes to Lorena's rescue. Philippe then walks downstairs, and sees that the elevator door is open, and starts to go towards it, led by an imaginary Lorena. Thomas then begins a voodoo ritual with a needle and voodoo doll: as Philippe walks into the shaft, Thomas plunges the needle into the doll, and Philippe plunges to his death down the empty elevator shaft. Everyone is drawn to his screams, and Andrew goes down and finds Philippe's dead body along with the feathered beads. The sheriff is called and takes the body to perform an autopsy to see if alcohol was the factor or not, and forces the others to stay till he can figure it out. The next morning, Lorena and Andrew decide to go to into town to get away for a while, and begin to fall in love, while Harriet stays back at the house to help Thomas and Louette. After purchasing some plants, Andrew and Lorena are bombarded with a storm, and go back to the house. Harriet meanwhile, finds a creepy looking plant in the dining room, and discovers a snake inside, and then watches as it disappears! She quickly goes to her room, only to see the lock on Pauline's door fall off. She goes into the room and sees a voodoo shrine, and as she's looking at it, the rocking chair begins to move. She goes over to see who's there, and is bit on the arms by the rattlesnake sitting in the chair, falling unconscious. Andrew and Lorena find her and quickly take her to the doctor, while Thomas starts his ritual again, this time pulling out another voodoo doll. While Andrew is driving Lorena and Harriet, Harriet awakens and sees the hooded figure again. She starts to scream, only to die after Thomas stabs the needle into the second doll. Andrew is pulled over by the police who discover she is dead, and have them drive to the hospital, where they drop Harriet's body off. Then Andrew informs Lorena on the feathered beads he found at Philippe and Harriet's death, and decides to go back to figure it all out, taking a frightened Lorena with him. Andrew begins to read one of the many voodoo books in the house, while keeping watch of Lorena who is sleeping. Andrew begins to fall asleep, as Thomas once again performs a ritual, in which a snake slithers all over Lorena's sleeping body, until she awakens and faints. Then she is put into a trance, and gets up and leaves the room. Andrew awakens to discover Lorena is gone, and begins to look for her. He finds Louette downstairs, who leads him to the place where Lorena had gone: a passageway at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Andrew goes in and discovers Louette is gone, and enters a room filled with a bunch of people dancing to a voodoo ritual, all around Louette, who is now tied to a pole in the center of the room. During the ritual, a male dancer begins to dance around with a snake, and Thomas comes out with a knife slashing at Louette who is begging him to snap out of it. Then the male dancer starts to slash at Louette, and Thomas and the dancer take turns scaring her by slashing close to her face and stomach. Then Thomas takes the knife and stabs Louette in the chest, killing her. He then starts to dance and pulls Lorena out from the crowd to join in the ritual, only to have Andrew come in with a machete. Lorena starts to snap out of it, as Thomas magically makes a machete appear in his hand. The two men fight, while the dancer attacks Andrew. After knocking the dancer out, Andrew has his machete knocked out of his hands.

To make ends meet, she smuggles money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie , a gun runner under the close watch of the ATF. Ordell learns that another of his workers, Beaumont Livingston , has been arrested. Fearing that Livingston will become an informant in order to avoid jail time, Ordell arranges for his bail with bondsman Max Cherry . Following his release, Ordell promptly lures Livingston out to be killed. Acting on information Livingston had indeed shared, ATF agent Ray Nicolette  and LAPD detective Mark Dargas intercept Jackie as she arrives in the United States with Ordell's cash and some cocaine that Brown was unaware was stashed in her bag. Initially refusing to deal with Nicolette and Dargas, she is sent to jail on possession of drugs with intent to sell. Sensing that Jackie may now be just as likely to inform as Livingston had been, Ordell goes back to Max to arrange her bail. Max arrives to pick her up and, only partly masking his attraction to her, offers to buy her a drink and help determine her legal options. Ordell later arrives at Jackie's house intending to murder her. She surprises him by pulling a gun she surreptitiously borrowed from Max's glove compartment, however, and barters a deal with Ordell whereby she will pretend to help the authorities while still managing to smuggle $500,000 of Ordell's money, enough to allow him to retire. To carry out this plan, Ordell employs Melanie Ralston , a woman he lives with, and Louis Gara , a friend and former cellmate. He also uses a naïve Southern girl, Sheronda. With Jackie's help, Nicolette and Dargas arrange a sting to catch Ordell, unaware that Jackie and Ordell plan to double-cross them by diverting the actual money before the authorities make an arrest. Unbeknownst to the others, Jackie plans to deceive all of them with the help of Max in order to keep the $500,000 for herself. After a trial run, during which Nicolette could observe the operation, the stage is set for the actual event. In a large shopping mall near Los Angeles, Jackie buys a new suit and enters a dressing room. Her role is to swap bags there with Melanie and Louis, supposedly passing off the $500,000 under Nicolette's nose. Instead, she gives Melanie only $50,000 and leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for Max to pick up. Jackie then feigns despair as she calls Nicolette and Dargas out from hiding and claims Melanie took all the money and ran. In the parking lot, Melanie annoys and mocks Louis until he loses his temper and shoots her. Ordell discovers that Louis has only $40,000 in the bag . Ordell realizes his money has been stolen and, also angered to learn that Louis shot Melanie, kills Louis. Ordell's next concern is the involvement of Max Cherry, having been told by Louis that he spotted Max in the store before the pickup. Lured back to Max's office, where Jackie is said to be frightened and waiting to hand over his money, Ordell arrives armed. Jackie yells out that Ordell has a gun and he is shot dead by Nicolette, who had been hiding in another room. In the clear with the law and in possession of the money, minus a 10% cut that Max has taken for himself, Jackie decides to leave the country and travel to Madrid, Spain. Jackie invites Max to leave with her, but he declines before Jackie kisses him goodbye and leaves.\",\n",

His fit makes Doraemon angry and being a hot Japanese summer, he goes to \"cool off\" at the North Pole with the Anywhere Door. Nobita follows him there after he\\'s gone for a long time, and discovers a strange bowling ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons what looks like a giant robot´s foot. After sledding down the hill on it and having it crash into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls into his backyard. Doraemon, who returned covered in ice, thaws out and wakes up with a cold. When Nobita thanks him for summoning up the parts for a giant robot for him, Doraemon is astonished and admits that he knows nothing about them. However, using a combination of the Opposite World Entrance Oil and the Roll-Up Fishing Hole, they go to the \"World Inside the Mirror\"  and build the robot. Finally, Nobita dubs the robot \"Zanda Cross\", since he feels that the bowling ball that\\'s summoning the parts was a gift from Santa Claus at the North Pole. Using a brain-wave controller that Doraemon pulls out of his pocket, he and Nobita play around with the robot, making it do gymnastic moves over bridges and such. Not to keep things to himself, Nobita returns home and brings Shizuka back with him to play with the robot together, but Shizuka presses a button on the control panel that makes the robot fire a huge laser beam, resulting in the destruction of half of the city. Seeing this, they group realizes just how dangerous \"Zanda Cross\" really is, so they decide to return to the real world and forget about ever finding the robot. However, Nobita forgot about the bowling ball-like orb he brought back with him, which has been sending telepathic messages to a mysterious girl named Lilulu. She is the owner of Zanda Cross, and is looking to reclaim it. Following the orb\\'s messages, she seeks out Nobita, who accidentally lets slip that he knows about the robot. Lilulu proceeds to force him into showing her where it is, so Nobita borrows the Roll-Up Fishing Hole from the spare pocket Doraemon keeps in the closet and takes her to the World Inside the Mirror. She reclaims Zanda Cross, and asks Nobita if she can borrow the Roll-Up Fishing Hole for a while, to which Nobita agrees. After some time, Nobita is visibly nervous about what she is up to, and after seeing two shooting stars in a row, uses the Bamboo Copter to fly over and see what is going on. Flying over the forest by Mt. Ura, he discovers the Roll-Up Fishing Hole unrolled with a portal to the World Inside the Mirror open. When another \"shooting star\" falls from the sky directly into the portal, Nobita follows it into the other world and discovers that it is one of the parts for building a massive robot army and that Riruru is at the center of it all. Doraemon, who was suspicious of Nobita\\'s peculiar behavior at home and had followed him there, uses a long-range Paper Cup Phone to listen in on her, and discovers that Lilulu is actually a robot who hates all humans. Upon Lilulu discovering that she was being listened in on, she chases after Nobita and Doraemon. After returning to their own world, Zanda Cross, on Lilulu\\'s orders, tries to get through the portal as well, resulting in its destruction, seemingly separating the two worlds forever. The two have completely forgotten about the bowling ball orb that is still at home, however. It then wakes up, and starts bouncing around. So Doraemon pulls out a special kind of incubator and puts the bowling ball and Doraemon\\'s Translation Jelly in it, causing the bowling ball to speak. The ball reveals itself as the \\'brain\\' of Zanda Cross and he alerts Doaremon of a giant robot army who are involved in a plot to enslave all humanity, so that robot-kind can take over the Earth. Doraemon then reprograms Zanda Cross\\' brain so that the robot becomes their ally. Doraemon and Nobita alert their friends, Gian and Suneo, about the robot invasion, and they decide to lure the robot army into the mirror world instead, while Shizuka takes care of fixing Lilulu after she discovers her very badly damaged. Despite everything Nobita and the others did for her, Lilulu still flees from them and later proceeds to shoot Nobita with a laser beam from her finger when he confronts her. When she meets up with her superiors, Lilulu instead changes her mind and decides that she is not going to support their plan on enslaving mankind. Enraged, the commander of the robot army orders her chained up and locked away for treason. Nobita and Doraemon, who had been watching the whole thing, later rescue her from her captors. Despite having won back the trust of Doraemon and his friends, Lilulu confesses that she has an inner conflict with herself and doesn\\'t know what she wants, so she willingly lets Doraemon lock her up in a bird cage using the Small Light. In the meantime, the robot army gets further suspicious because of there being no humans in the world. They then discover that they are in a fake world upon analyzing the satellite image of the world and the same image of the current world and seeing how they are reversed. The robot army discovers the newly-made portal that Doraemon made to get out of the fake world and into the real world and heard towards there, leaving Nobita, Doraemon, Gian, Suneo, and Zanda Cross to fight together to stop the robot army from destroying the planet, while Shizuka, with Doraemon\\'s spare pocket, is left behind to watch over the tiny Lilulu. As the team is gearing up for battle, an outburst from Suneo\\'s robot  gives Shizuka an idea. She enlarges Lilulu with the Big Light, uses the Walk-In Mirror to go back to the real world, takes the Anywhere Door to Nobita\\'s room, and takes the Time Machine in Nobita\\'s desk drawer back to 30,000 years ago, when a Professor was creating two robots who would become the ancestors of the Robot Army. After learning from the girls on what has happened in the future, the Professor realizes that the cause is the Competition Instinct program he installed in the robots, so he proceeds to replace it with a program that allows robots to have feelings and love. However, he collapses of old age before the process is completed. Lilulu then takes over, despite being aware that doing so would result in her demise. The process is soon completed, causing the evil robot army from the future to disappear from existence. Lilulu herself disappears after shaking hands with a grieving Shizuka and declaring each other as \"friends\". Although not shown on screen, it is implied that Zanda Cross is erased as well, since he was originally built by the Robot Army. The group is saddened by the loss of their new friends, but a reborn Lilulu later appears before Nobita and smiles at him before flying off. The movie ends with Nobita rushing to tell his friends of Lilulu\\'s rebirth while Lilulu, no longer a machine of destruction, watches over the Earth from outer space.',\n",

However, in the midst of his grief, Jones is puzzled by the circumstances of his son\\'s death and decides to use his old skills to conduct his own investigation, and approaches his friend Charles Greig ([[Barry Foster , who had joined MI6 after his service in the navy. Greig agrees to make discreet enquiries on his part. Returning to Robert\\'s flat, Jones is confronted by radical socialist journalist Bill Pickett  who had arranged to meet Robert to discuss the problems at British Intelligence, but Jones rejects his investigative approaches. Jones is also told that he is in the running for a large government contract for his firm, with an implicit undertone that he not make waves about his son\\'s death. The rest of the movie digs into an examination of the British establishment which is disturbing and ugly, and make Jones question his view of the country he loves. There are strong echoes of the Antony Blunt case and the Cambridge spies. Jones, discreetly pursued by British Intelligence, finds men who easily consider others expendable if their ideas of class and privilege are endangered. After Pickett is also killed in mysterious circumstances in a traffic accident, having found out the name of the man who Robert wished him to meet and before meeting Jones. Jones is then approached by Robert\\'s best friend and fellow British intelligence linguist Allen Goodburn  at Robert\\'s funeral. Jones gets from Goodburn that it was his good friend Grieg who had approached him as to Robert\\'s feelings for the service. Jones gets Grieg drunk and gets him to confess that he was at Robert\\'s flat the night Robert died. Grirg admits he was there as the service had something on him, but that his job was only to leave the door open and let \"others\" heavy hand Robert, not kill him. Leaving Grieg in his drunken stupor, Jones is picked up by British Intelligence and driven to a country house, where he is confronted by Secretary to the Cabinet  and Lord . They explain to him that his son was out of control, and was killed as part of a plan to mislead the Americans to the extent of the depth of Russian intelligence\\'s operatives inside British operations, in the hope that they could continue to gain intelligence from the CIA. They have presently left the higher Russian operative in place, until they can assess the extent of the damage caused. They advise Jones that should he go public with any of this information, he and/or Robert\\'s girlfriend Cynthia and her daughter will be killed or at least restrained. As a door to a further dining room opens, Jones notices Sir Adrian Chapple  and concludes him to be the higher level Russian operative. The film returns to the present, and Remembrance Day parade. Jones confronts Chapple at his home in Whitehall, and gets him to confess to being a spy for Russia. Jones asks Chapple to sign a full confession, which he does, but on approaching the desk where Chapple writes, Chapple points a gun at Jones. Jones turns the gun on Chapple, which goes off and kills Chapple—leaving his signed confession to act as a suicide note, and leave Jones in the clear. Jones returns to the Remembrance Day parade. The closing credits roll to an ambulance attending the death of Chapple, as Caine walks past the Cenotaph up Whitehall.',\n",

              " 'Robert \"Rack\" Hansen , a veterinarian in rural Verde Valley, Arizona, United States, receives an urgent call from a local farmer, Walter Colby . Colby is upset because his prize calf has become sick for no apparent reason, and brings the animal to Hansen\\'s laboratory. Hansen examines the calf, which dies shortly afterward. Hansen tells Colby he cannot explain what made the animal so ill so quickly, but takes samples of the calf\\'s blood to a university lab in Flagstaff. A few days later, Diane Ashley , an arachnologist, arrives looking for Hansen. Ashley tells Hansen that the calf was killed by a massive dose of spider venom, which Hansen greets with skepticism. Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal\\'s carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby\\'s farm. Moments after they arrive, Colby\\'s wife, Birch , discovers their dog is dead. Ashley performs a quick chemical test on the dog\\'s carcass and concludes that like the calf, it died from a massive injection of spider venom. Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive \"spider hill\" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas. Ashley theorizes that the tarantulas are converging together due to the heavy use of pesticides, which are eradicating their natural food supply. In order to survive, the spiders are joining forces to attack and eat larger animals. Hansen and Ashley return to the Colby farm. As the scientists and the Colbys are walking past a barn, a bull stampedes out; it is being attacked by tarantulas. Ashley notes that the spiders likely will not be afraid to attack people either. Colby douses the spider hill with gasoline and lights it on fire, seemingly destroying the spider menace. However, many of the spiders escape out of a tunnel. Colby is attacked in his truck the next day, sending it over the side of a hill and killing him. Hansen happens upon the accident scene and helps the sheriff, Gene Smith , examine the wreckage. Colby\\'s body is found encased in a cocoon of spider webs. Meanwhile, Ashley is notified by her colleagues that a sample of venom from one of the spiders is five times more toxic than normal. Hansen is then told by the sheriff that several more spider hills have been located on Colby\\'s property. Hansen, Ashley and the sheriff examine the hills along with the mayor of Camp Verde , who orders the sheriff to spray the hills and the surrounding countryside with a pesticide. Ashley protests, arguing that pesticide use is what caused the problem to begin with and that the town would be better off using birds and rats  to eradicate them. The mayor dismisses the idea, fearing that having a large number of spiders and rats all over the countryside will scare away patrons of the annual county fair. A crop duster is enlisted to spray the pesticide. Once the pilot is airborne, he is attacked by tarantulas, and crashes the plane before he can disperse the spray. The spiders begin their assault on the local residents, killing Birch and Hansen\\'s sister-in-law, Terri . Hansen arrives at their home and rescues Terri\\'s daughter, Linda from the spiders. Hansen and Ashley take Linda to the Washburn Lodge. They consult with the sheriff, who tells them that the spiders are everywhere and Camp Verde cut off from the outside world. Smith drives into town, while Hansen and the other survivors at the lodge plan to load up an RV and escape. However, the spiders trap them in the lodge, and they barricade themselves inside. Meanwhile, Smith arrives in Camp Verde and finds the town under siege by the spiders. Smith tries to escape, but is killed when another car crashes into a support post under the town\\'s water tower, causing it to fall on his vehicle. Back at the lodge, the power goes out, and Hansen is forced to venture into the lodge\\'s basement to change a blown fuse. He succeeds, but is besieged by spiders who break through one of the basement windows, by using their combined weight. He makes it upstairs just in time to be saved by Ashley. The film concludes the next day, with the survivors rigging up a radio receiver and listening for news of the attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn\\'t mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened. Hansen pries off the boards from one of the lodge\\'s windows, and discovers that the entire building is encased in a giant web cocoon. The camera pulls back, and all of Camp Verde is encased in cocoons as well.',\n",

              " 'The story takes place during a twenty-four hour period while four family members vacation on a remote island, shortly after one of them, Karin , who suffers from schizophrenia, was released from an asylum. Karin\\'s husband Martin  tells her father, David, that Karin\\'s disease is almost incurable. Meanwhile, Minus , Karin\\'s 17-year-old brother, tells Karin that he wishes he could have a real conversation with his father, and cries because he feels deprived of his father\\'s affection. David  is a novelist suffering from a \"writer\\'s block\" who has just returned from a long trip abroad. He announces he will leave again in a month, though he promised he would stay. The others are upset, and David gives them unthoughtful, last-minute presents. He leaves them and sobs alone for a moment. When he returns, the others cheerfully announce that they too have a \"surprise\" for David; they perform a play for him that Minus has written. David takes offense  at the play, which can be interpreted as an attack on his character. That night, after rejecting Martin’s erotic overtures, Karin wakes up and follows the sound of a foghorn to the attic. She faints after an episode in which she hears voices behind the peeling wallpaper. David, meanwhile, has stayed up all night working on his manuscript. Karin enters his room and tells him she can\\'t sleep, and David tucks her in. Minus asks David to come with him out of the house, and David leaves. Karin looks through David\\'s desk and finds his diary, learning that her disease is incurable and that her father has a callous hunger to record the details of her deterioration. The following morning, David and Martin, while fishing, confront each other over Karin. Martin accuses David of sacrificing his daughter for his art, and of being a self-absorbed, callous, cowardly phony. David is evasive, but admits that much of what Martin says is true. David says that he recently tried to kill himself by driving over a cliff, but was saved by a faulty transmission. He says that after that, he discovered that he loves Karin, Minus and Martin, and this gives him hope. Meanwhile, Karin tells Minus about her episodes, and that she is waiting for God to appear behind the wallpaper in the attic. Minus is somewhat sexually frustrated, and Karin teases him, even more so after she discovers that he hides a men\\'s magazine. Later, on the beach, when Karin sees that a storm is coming, she runs into a wrecked ship and huddles in fear. Minus goes to her and she grabs him. Though the act is not shown the film suggests that Karin has sexually seduced her brother. Minus tells the other men about the incident in the ship and Martin calls for an ambulance. Karin asks to speak with her father alone. She confesses her misconduct toward Martin and Minus, saying that a voice told her to act that way and also to search David\\'s desk. She tells David she would like to remain at the hospital, because she cannot go back and forth between two realities — she must choose one. While they are packing to go to the hospital, she runs to the attic, where Martin and David observe her actions. She says that God is about to walk out of the closet door, and asks her husband to allow her to enjoy the moment. The ambulance, a helicopter, flies by the window, making a lot of noise and shaking the door open. Karin moves toward the door eagerly, but then she runs from it, terrified, and goes into a frenzy of panic. Karin vanishes, and, reappearing in a frenzy, is sedated. When she stands, she tells them of God: an evil-faced spider who tried to penetrate her. She looked into God\\'s eyes, and they were \"cold and calm,\" and when God failed to penetrate her he retreated onto the wall. \"I have seen God,\" she announces. Karin and Martin leave in the helicopter. Minus tells his father that he is afraid, because when Karin had grabbed him in the ship, he began leaving ordinary reality. He asks his father if he can survive that way. David tells him he can if he has \"something to hold on to.\" He tells Minus of his own hope: love. David and his son discuss the concept of love as it relates to God, and the factor of human father-child relationships in the perception of God, in the stretching final chapter of the film. Minus seems relieved, and is tearfully happy that he finally had a real conversation with his father: \"Father spoke to me.\"',\n",

              " 'The film opens in 1922, as Joe O\\'Reilly  attempts to console Kitty Kiernan , who is mourning the death of Michael Collins. The film flashes back to the end of the Easter Rising in 1916, as Collins , Harry Boland , Éamon de Valera , and other survivors surrender to the British Army. As the Dublin Metropolitan Police\\'s \"G\" Division identifies the leaders, Collins tells Boland that next time, \"We won\\'t play by their rules, Harry. We\\'ll invent our own.\" All the other leaders die by firing squad, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned in Britain. Collins, Boland, and the others are sent to Frongoch internment camp. After his release, Collins runs for a seat in the First Dáil. While giving a speech, the rally is attacked by the Royal Irish Constabulary. Collins is severely beaten, but is rescued by Boland. While recovering on a friend\\'s farm, they meet Kitty, who begins a romance with Boland. Collins is tipped off by Detective Ned Broy  that the British plan to arrest de Valera and his Cabinet. However, de Valera forbids anyone to go into hiding, stating that the ensuing public outcry will force their immediate release. Only Collins and Boland escape arrest and imprisonment, and there are no protests. Left in command, Collins orders the IRA to begin raiding police barracks for weapons. He also issues a statement that all collaboration with the British will be punished by death. Collins then recruits a squad from the IRA\\'s Dublin Brigade, which, on Bloody Sunday, assassinates fourteen members of MI5\\'s Cairo Gang. In retaliation, the Black and Tans fire into the crowd at a Gaelic football match at Croke Park. Broy is caught burning documents and killed. Later, Boland and Collins travel to Britain and break de Valera out of Lincoln prison. Angry that Collins has overshadowed him, de Valera announces that he will travel to the United States to seek recognition from Woodrow Wilson, and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins informs Boland that de Valera fears leaving them alone together. After returning, de Valera decrees that the IRA must attack The Custom House. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Irish Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only hold out for a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his shock, however, the British soon call for a cease fire. Collins is ordered to London to participate in negotiations with the British, despite objecting that he is not a diplomat. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, de Valera erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Collins argues that the Treaty gives them the freedom to achieve the Republic. De Valera and his supporters resign in protest after the Dáil approves the Treaty by 64-57. Both Collins and de Valera try to sway the Irish people in their respective directions. Collins is attacked by an anti-Treaty Republican during a rally, but escapes. In the aftermath, he asks Kitty Kiernan to marry him and she accepts. When the people vote to approve the Treaty, de Valera refuses to accept the results and orders the IRA to seize the Four Courts in Dublin. Ordered by the Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins is appalled at having to fight former comrades. Arthur Griffith, however, informs him that, if the Irish Free State Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins\\' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the Liffey. Devastated by Boland\\'s death, Collins travels to County Cork. He reaches out to de Valera through an intermediary, asking for a peace conference. Without de Valera\\'s knowledge, the intermediary informs Collins that de Valera will meet him at Béal na Bláth the following day. As a convoy of Irish Army vehicles approaches, IRA men open fire from a nearby hillside. Collins is shot and killed. Kitty is informed of his death just after trying on her wedding gown. Completing his story, O\\'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has. The film ends with a montage of footage from Collins\\' funeral.

              " 'Christian Martin, a modest accountant in a large firm owned by Bertrand Barnier, surprises his boss by asking him for a 100% increase in his wages. Martin is on the point of proposing to a girl and doesn\\'t want to ask for her hand in marriage while making a lowly accountant\\'s salary. After Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he\\'s stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm\\'s accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm. Martin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier\\'s daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank. While Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette. Without mentioning Martin, he tells her that he\\'s opposed to her marriage which causes her to break down and cry. On the advice of her maid Bernadette, Colette lies to her father and tells him that she\\'s pregnant by her lover. Hearing this, Barnier decides to approve the marriage and give the sixty million francs/jewelry to Colette as a wedding present. After Barnier\\'s talk with Colette a young woman named Jacqueline Bouillotte comes to see him. She tells Barnier that she\\'s in love with Christian Martin and that she lied to him and told him that she was Barnier\\'s daughter. Barnier realizes that this means that Martin is not in love with his daughter Colette. It also dawns on him that he won’t be able to get his sixty million francs back from Martin or his daughter since they won’t be getting married. Upon confronting Colette, Barnier learns that she\\'s in love with Oscar the chauffer. At that moment Martin comes back from the bank and Barnier gets the jewelry, now in a black suitcase, from him. Martin then learns that Jacqueline has lied to him about being Barnier\\'s daughter, which causes them to argue and break up. In the meantime Barnier has discovered that Oscar had joined a six year polar expedition due to a \"disappointment of love\"  Barnier tells Martin that he\\'ll give him back the suitcase with the jewelry if he\\'ll marry Colette. Martin hesitates and tries to put Barnier on to a new \"pigeon\": Philippe Dubois, Barnier\\'s masseur. During this time, Colette\\'s maid Bernadette announces her resignation and packs her suitcase; she is going to marry Colette\\'s former fiancé the Baron Honoré de la Butinière. Before she leaves the house Bernadette puts down her suitcase filled with clothes and accidentally picks up the suitcase containing the sixty million francs worth of jewelry. Barnier tries to persuade his masseur to marry his daughter Colette, promising to give him the suitcase full of jewelry as a wedding present. Barnier almost has a heart attack when he opens the suitcase and finds clothes inside instead of jewels. At this point, Martin comes back and tells Barnier that before he had gone to the bank, while they were discussing giving the jewelry to Colette as a wedding present, he had hidden a piece of paper among the documents. When Barnier had signed an agreement to give Colette the jewelry, he had also signed a document giving Martin banking power of attorney. This allowed Martin to divert sixty million more francs from Barnier\\'s accounts. Martin offers to exchange this second stolen sum for the jewelry representing the first stolen sum. Barnier gives Martin the suitcase with the jewelry thinking it\\'s the suitcase full of clothes. However, unbeknownst to him Bernadette\\'s driver had come back with the suitcase of jewelry and exchanged it for the suitcase of clothes. Barnier, thinking he\\'s given Martin the clothes, invents an address for Jacqueline, Martin\\'s true love, and sends him on his way. After a series of comic errors, Barnier again finds himself with Bernadette\\'s suitcase full of clothes. After a funny telephone conversation with the Baron, Bernadette\\'s new husband, Barnier recovers the suitcase filled with jewelry from Martin who has discovered that the address Barnier had given him for Jacqueline is wrong. Barnier, pleased to have finally recovered the suitcase filled with jewelry confesses to inventing the address to get rid of Martin and tells him that Jacqueline  is in fact in Barnier\\'s office. While all of this is going on a lady named Charlotte enters the house. She\\'s been sent by the employment agency to replace Bernadette as Colette\\'s maid. She tells Barnier that when she was younger she worked for the Barnier family and that she had a daughter who is now engaged to a man named Christian Martin. Barnier realizes that the young woman being discussed is Jacqueline and Charlotte reveals that Jacqueline is in fact Charlotte and Barnier\\'s daughter. Barnier needs several minutes to recover from the shock during which time Oscar returns home to Colette and all seems to end well. However...while everybody is congratulating each other, Bernadette arrives thinking that there has been a mistake with the suitcases. Not wanting to disturb anyone she inconspicuously exchanges the suitcases. Barnier asks Martin to open the now famous suitcase, thinking that he is going to take the jewelry out of it and give it to his daughters as a wedding present. He has an apoplectic fit on seeing that it\\'s full of clothes. Everybody jumps in cars, on motorbikes, and on bicycles to go to Bernadette\\'s and recover the suitcase of jewelry once and for all.',\n",
              " \"The film starts with a group of college students enjoying a picnic in a beautiful forest in Ooty. One of the girls, Nisha  in that group, dies after being attacked under mysterious circumstances outside a bungalow in front of the forest. She had attacked her boyfriend too, who, though injured, managed to live on. She was rushed to the hospital, where just before dying, her facial look and voice changed completely for a short while, thus confusing all the attending doctors. Professor Agni Swaroop , who is supposedly an expert in phenomena involving the unexplained and the supernatural is called by the police to look into the matter and declares that the girl was killed by an evil spirit that has been awakened by her entering the forest. The story then turns to Sanjana Dhanraj  and Aditya Dhanraj  in Mumbai in a business party, where Aditya seems too busy to pay heed to the fact that his wife is longing to talk to him. She snatches the car keys from Aditya's pocket and leaves the party to return home. On her frantic drive home, she hears a voice in her head and loses control of the car. However, miraculously, she escapes the accident unscathed. After her recovery, Sanjana asks her husband for a divorce; Aditya, however, realizes his fault and suggests a vacation to work out their problems. He offers Sanjana a trip to any corner of the world for some days and Sanjana chooses to return to Ooty  in order to save their failing marriage. In Ooty they stay in the same bungalow behind which Nisha was attacked. Initially, the couple enjoy their stay at the cottage but soon Sanjana starts experiencing mysterious things, such as hearing a woman screaming in the forest behind the cottage and inexplicable falling objects. She later learns that their housekeeper's husband, Robert, also used to hear strange voices from the forest, and that he ran from the house in fear once he could bear it no more. She shares her problems with her friend Priya , a local girl, who advises Sanjana to visit professor Swaroop. The professor arrives at the cottage and after a short investigation announces the presence of a spirit in the house. He also tells Sanjana about the earlier incident involving the girl who was attacked and killed by an evil spirit in those very woods. He then re-visits the same spot in the forest where Nisha was attacked. He was accompanied by Priya and Sanjana too. Sanjana goes alone to talk to that spirit, where after some time, she discovers a revolver. All three of them go to an arms store to learn more and are told by the shopkeeper that the revolver was licensed to a retired colonel named Col. Arjun Malik. They visit the colonel's house, suspecting him to be a murderer of innocent girls, but soon learn from the colonel that the spirit is actually his own daughter, Malini , who was mentally ill and had managed to escape from the mental asylum several times. Using the methodology suggested by the professor, Sanjana summons the spirit, believing that the spirit wants to tell her something. The spirit conveys that Malini had met Aditya when he came to Ooty the previous year for work. When Sanjana confronts Aditya, he admits that he had stayed at the same cottage where Sanjana and Aditya were currently staying. They eventually learn that that Malini and Aditya had an affair and that Aditya rebuked Malini's demands that he leave his wife, claiming that the affair was never meant to be anything more than physical. An enraged Malini commits suicide in front of Aditya inside of his home. Aditya, with the help of his then manservant Robert, buried the dead girl's body in the forest behind the cottage. Sanjana storms off in anger leaving Aditya alone. The professor tells Sanjana that all this was an attempt by Malini's spirit to separate Sanjana and Aditya in order to take him with her into the afterlife. He believes that the spirit's next step would be to kill Aditya and that they should rush to Aditya before Malini attacks him. Sanjana goes to Aditya and tells him that she is doing this just to save him and that they should leave for Mumbai in their car immediately. After they leave, Sanjana, Priya and the Prof Swaroop arrive at the cottage where the bewildered maid tells them that Aditya just left with her. Prof Swaroop realizes that the earlier Sanjana was Malini's spirit in disguise and they rush after the car. Malini's spirit meanwhile causes the car in which Aditya is travelling to fall off a cliff. Aditya goes into a coma and is hospitalised. To prevent the spirit from succeeding in her plans, Sanjana, Priya and the professor go into the forest to locate the girl's body to burn it. The professor is killed by the spirit and then possessed by her and attacks Sanjana during this episode, where Sanjana also discovers the dead body of the husband of the maid who first told Sanjana about the strange voices. At the last moment, Sanjana manages to burn the body, thereby liberating the girl's spirit and saving Aditya's life. The film ends with Aditya and Sanjana reuniting.\",\n",

As the day progresses we see Ian in a taxi. He tells the driver  about how he and Sam are going through difficulties. The driver recommends he should just love her. After Sam's concert that night, Ian tries to dismiss Sam's favorite student. At dinner Sam confronts Ian where her frustration boils over. She gets angry at Ian for his attitude toward her and tells him that she just wants him to love her. Sam storms out of the restaurant in tears, Ian following close behind and asking for her forgiveness. Sam gets in a passing taxi and as Ian tries to get in beside her he notices that the driver is the same man who he traveled with earlier that day. The man gives Ian an ominous smile and as the clock hits 11 PM, Sam closes the door, leaving Ian standing there. As he watches the taxi drive away, Ian makes one last attempt to reconcile with Sam and runs after the taxi as it stops at a traffic light. Before he gets there, the lights change and the taxi begins driving again. As it speeds up, the taxi is struck violently by another car and comes to a stop on the middle of the street. Ian halts and falls on his knees in shock. At a nearby hospital, Sam is being taken into the ER and Ian is running through the hospital looking for her. He arrives outside the room where Sam was and through a windows sees her wounded and surrounded by medical personnel. Sam looks over to the window towards Ian, a blank expression on her face. Ian begins to cry and before the doctors can help her, Sam succumbs to her injuries and dies. Ian falls to the floor in the hospital in disbelief. We see Sam's friend Lottie  enter a hospital room, where Ian is sitting in a chair. They both begin to cry. Ian goes back to his apartment, finds Sam's notebook and opens it, finding a song she was working on. He falls asleep clutching the notebook close to him. As the next day begins, Ian wakes up with the notebook still held tight. He is shocked to hear a voice behind him tell him not to read a word. He jumps up and screams, only to see Sam standing in his apartment. After the initial confusion, Ian comes to the conclusion that the previous day must have been a dream and continues the morning, happy to have Sam by his side As the morning progresses however, Sam gets burnt by her hair straighteners in the same place she had been burnt by the kettle in his supposed dream. Able to shake this off as a sheer coincidence, Ian takes no further notice of it. Other events similar to those he already experienced begin happening too, although at different times and in different ways, as Sam gets Coca-Cola spilt on her. This time Ian mentions his dream to her, and she convinces him that it was just a dream, and if his watch remains in working order then it can't possibly be the same day as his dream. Nonetheless, Ian is still cautious, and while in a meeting at work he holds his folder in his hands. Sam sees this from outside the glass doors and his meeting is left uninterrupted. Later in the day, Ian gets into a taxi. After talking to the taxi driver he realizes that the driver is the man from the previous day. He questions the man about this and the driver says he does not remember, although he once again gives Ian an ominous smile, implying he may in fact know about Sam's accident and all the previous events. This convinces Ian once and for all, and he runs to Sam, who's helping her friend Lottie set up for an art gallery. After convincing her to come with him, he brings her to a train station. After much questioning Sam reveals they are traveling to Ian's rural home town. A delighted Sam makes sure that she'll be back in time for her concert, which Ian ensures they will be. Ian brings Sam up a mountain, to a spot he used to visit as a child. The two find a little abandoned cottage on the mountainside to use as shelter during a rain storm. Upon setting up a fire while Sam sits down, Ian notices that his watch is cracked and isn't working. He turns to look at Sam, who's lighting candles on a table. Sam smiles and when Ian asks what she would do if she didn't have a lot of time left, she replies that she'd do what she's doing right now; spending time with him, just being together. Ian and Sam begin kissing, before making love. Afterwards, they make their way back down the mountain, disappointed that they never made it to Ian's spot. In the town below, the two have drinks and Ian tells Sam about his father, who lost his beloved job in 1993 before becoming an alcoholic and dying sometime later. Ian reveals that he wishes he could have helped his father more, but Sam says he was only a child at the time and wherever his father is now, he's proud of him. The two travel back to London and Ian takes Sam on the London Eye as another surprise. They then travel back to their apartment and while Sam is distracted, Ian takes a page from her notebook and brings it to a nearby photocopying shop while Sam travels to her concert with her violin. Before the show begins Ian sends a bouquet of flowers up to Sam and gives the photocopied pages to an organizer. A puzzled Sam looks out to Ian in the crowd when her bouquet arrives. His plan is soon revealed however when Ian comes onto center-stage with a microphone. He calls a reluctant Sam to his side, who gets nervous. Ian goes and talks to Sam at her seat and tells her she doesn't want to disappoint her future fans. Sam proceeds onto the stage as the orchestra begins to play the song printed on Ian's photocopied sheets. She sings the song she wrote for Ian in her notebook and the crowd burst into applause at her performance. While walking to a restaurant of Sam's choice, she describes her feelings to Ian. In an intimate surrounding, Sam and Ian discuss the day in a sheer contrast to Ian's experience the previous night. Ian gives Samantha a charm bracelet with different charms and symbols: a musical note, a violin, a flower , the train they took that day and the Eiffel Tower, which Sam had always wanted to see. The two sit in silence as Sam tears up and smiles across at Ian. As they leave the restaurant in a downpour, Sam tries to get a taxi to take them home. Ian realizes they are in the same spot as the previous night when the accident took place and tells her to look at him and listen. In the rain, Sam listens as Ian professes his love for her and tells her that if it weren't for her or today, he would never have known true love at all. Sam begins crying and says she doesn't know what to say, to which he replies that she doesn't need to say anything. A taxi pulls up and Sam gets in, beckoning Ian to get in too. He gets in next to her. As the taxi approaches the traffic lights, Ian and Sam kiss. He looks forward and sees the clock strike 11 PM and the same ominous smile he has seen so many times already. Sam smiles at him as the taxi pulls away and images of Sam's accident flash through his mind. He sees a car light through his window and grabs Sam tight for the last time. Sam's scream can be heard. At the hospital, we see Sam's friend Lottie run through the halls. She turns a corner and enters a hospital room, where Sam is sitting in a bed. Sam tells Lottie about Ian's premonition and how she didn't believe him. She and Lottie begin to cry. In the end it was Ian who was the victim of the accident. Six months later, Sam is sitting in the apartment, with Ian's watch in her hands. Everything is packed into boxes and Sam takes a last look at the room. We see her singing on stage in a restaurant, with Lottie sitting at the closest table to her. She travels to the cottage on the mountain which she and Ian visited and continues climbing until she reaches Ian's spot at the peak of the mountain. She stands at the top, staring out into a valley, not knowing what lies ahead.\",\n",
              " 'Rick Latimer  is a high-school teacher with a drinking problem. Spotting his ex-wife in a bar one night, Rick gets into a fight with the man she\\'s with, culminating in his beating the hapless man\\'s car with a baseball bat. The board of education finds that Rick\\'s behavior is reflecting poorly on the school district\\'s image. They unanimously decide to transfer him to another school, in another district; Brandel High, a crime-ridden and gang-dominated institution, where he is made the new principal. Believing he can repair his image by cleaning up the school, Rick attempts to have an assembly to declare his intentions: \"No more.\" No more drugs, running in the hallways or being late to class. While he\\'s giving his speech, Victor Duncan , the leader of the main gang in the school, walks in, derides Rick in front of everyone, then walks out, which eventually results in a small riot, which earns Rick the enmity of not only the teachers but also school custodian Jake . Eventually, Rick manages to enforce his policy of getting rid of the drugs being dealt in the bathrooms and clearing out the hallways — but not always with success. Because the students are now forced to go to class, some of the more unruly students become increasingly disruptive, including White Zac , who eventually attempts to rape one of the teachers, Ms. Orozco , with whom Rick is beginning to form a close friendship. Victor, meanwhile, continues to assert his influence on the school, going so far as to brutally beat a former member of his gang and hang him by his ankles when the member warms to Rick and actually starts learning. The clash between Rick and Victor eventually leads to a showdown in the school halls, where Jake is temporarily locked inside a supply closet while Victor and his gang hunt Rick down. In the end, Victor and Rick fight each other with their fists, with Victor seemingly having the upper hand until Rick overpowers him. Rick beats Victor, much to the shock of the rest of the school who witness the beating. Several students cheer Rick on, much to the chagrin of Victor\\'s gang members. After a small fight breaks out Rick again declares, \"No more!\" Victor is taken away in a police car, and as a student derisively asks, \"Hey man, who the hell do you think you are?\", Rick responds \"I\\'m the principal, man!\" and rides away on his motorcycle.',\n",
              " 'Diego de la Vega  is about to return to Spain from the New World when he chances to meet his old friend, Miguel de la Serna. Miguel has just been appointed the new governor of Nuova Aragon after the death of his uncle, Don Fernando. Diego tries to warn Miguel that Nuova Aragon has been ruled by greed and hatred for many generations and that Miguel\\'s uncle  was probably murdered, but Miguel, who is consumed by pacifistic humanitarian ideals, will not listen. Later that same evening, Miguel is attacked by several men while walking outside the inn. Diego arrives and, with stunning swordplay, defeats the men and forces one of them to talk. The man says that Colonel Huerta  sent them to kill Miguel. Dying, Miguel agrees to let Diego go in his place, but makes him swear that \"the new Governor will never kill.\" Diego reluctantly agrees. Months later in Nuova Aragon, Colonel Huerta asks the council for complete control of the army and government. Just then, Diego  arrives and announces that he is the new governor. He then meets Miguel\\'s aunt, Carmen , who is little inclined to have any kind of familial relationship with her \"nephew\". He also meets Kapitan Fritz von Markel , the head of the Governor\\'s personal guard, and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt via a bowl of poisoned sweets . Diego and Joaquin  watch Huerta force his men through a grueling fencing practice; afterwards, Huerta slices through candles without disturbing them, showing off his skill. In response to the Governor\\'s request for \"personal safety\", he appoints Sergeant Garcia , an overweight soldier with more than a bit of an appetite, as the Governor\\'s bodyguard. Later, in Diego\\'s room, the dog Assassin shows Diego and Joaquin a secret passageway behind a bookshelf. In disguise, Diego and Joaquin roam the streets of Nuova Aragon, seeing how much the people have been cowed. Two incidents attract Diego\\'s attention: a group of boys causing mischief to corrupt merchants leaving behind a chalked \"Z\", and a monk named Brother Francisco trying to rouse the people against Huerta\\'s cruelty. After the monk is helped to evade capture by the soldiers by friendly townspeople, Diego and Joaquin question one of the boys, Chico. Although unwilling to talk at first, Chico is convinced to trust Diego and tells him about the legend of Zorro: \"the spirit of the black fox. He\\'s a great fighter and he always wins, he can never die.\" Bringing Brother Francisco\\'s cart back to him, Diego, Joaquin and Chico witness Brother Francisco being arrested by the soldiers. The next day, Brother Francisco has been unjustly sentenced to 20 lashes for fraud in selling rotten hides and slander against the merchant who has framed him. After a few lashes, Diego appears as Zorro, releases Brother Francisco and forces the soldiers to give \"the corrupt judge, the lying witness, and the murdering executioner\" three times the number of lashes Brother Francisco was sentenced to. Diego, once again as Serna, comments on a portrait of Hortensia Pulido  and is attracted to her. He is informed by Aunt Carmen that her family was once wealthy but now poor, a fact confirmed by Huerta who claims that the Pulidos were conspiring against the people of Nuova Aragon. Later in the town marketplace, Hortensia urges the people to rise up against the soldiers, saying that the scales the merchants use are rigged. Garcia shows up, ordering her to stop causing trouble and begins ridiculing Zorro. Suddenly Zorro appears and orders Garcia at sword-point to get on the scale, which shows that Garcia supposedly weighs \"only 50 pounds.\" After Zorro toys with the clumsy Garcia at swords for some time, soldiers appear, but since Chico and some other boys have dumped their rifles down a well, they are forced to go after Zorro with swords. Naturally, following an athletic chase through the marketplace Zorro escapes, and Hortensia looks on with admiration. Later, Hortensia returns to her home, where she finds Zorro waiting. Zorro and Hortensia talk for only a few moments before Huerta arrives. Hortensia urges Zorro to go, saying that she is afraid for him. Zorro leaves. Huerta arrives and tells his men to search the area. When Hortensia tells him that her parents aren\\'t home, he decides to stay for a while. After Hortensia rejects Huerta\\'s marriage proposal, he forcefully kisses her. At this, Zorro re-appears and  forces Huerta to get on his knees and beg Hortensia\\'s forgiveness. Huerta leaves in a huff, and Zorro and Hortensia share a romantic moment. Aunt Carmen has decided to return to Spain , escorted by Kapitan von Markel. Zorro and Joaquin, knowing that Huerta will certainly have his men rob the party in the guise of bandits, secretly follow. When the party makes camp for the night, the \"bandits\" attack, but von Markel  fights back and drives them off, exciting the admiration  of Carmen. The \"bandits\" escape with the treasure, but Zorro catches up with them and steals the jewels back. Diego begins an elaborate scheme, first with a scroll note from the dog, then a ransacked dining room marked with Z\\'s, to make it appear that Zorro is plotting to kill the Governor. After \"de la Serna\" takes to his bed in fear, Huerta informs Diego that he has the perfect plan to capture Zorro. He says his men will capture Hortensia, lock her in a cage and cart her around the plaza until Zorro comes to rescue her. Soldiers will be everywhere, so Zorro cannot escape. Zorro outwits them by going straight to Hortensia\\'s cell at the prison and waiting for her to arrive. He rescues Hortensia, and stays behind to distract the guards. Zorro escapes, and overhears Huerta and Garcia. Huerta says that only one other person knew of the plan. He rides off to the governor\\'s mansion, and Zorro manages to get back just before Huerta arrives. Huerta and Diego argue a bit about Zorro, and it is clear that Huerta is suspicious. Diego then offers himself to be bait for Zorro. The next day, Diego and Garcia go on a fishing trip. Soldiers are surrounding the area. Joaquin shows up as Zorro, and almost all the soldiers follow him. Eluding the soldiers, Joaquin rides to Brother Francisco\\'s mission. Brother Francisco informs the children of Zorro\\'s plan, and sends them out to different areas dressed as Zorro as distractions to the soldiers. Diego pretends to go to the carriage for a nap, but reappears as the real Zorro, telling Garcia he has the governor at gunpoint, and will \"wring his neck and have him stuffed and fed to the dog\" if Garcia doesn\\'t do what he tells him. Garcia, with Zorro, arrives at a mine run by forced slave labor. He orders the guards to release them all, or else Zorro will kill the Governor. With Brother Francisco\\'s help, the slaves are freed, and Zorro tells Garcia to leave. Hortensia arrives and tells Zorro that Huerta and the soldiers are coming. When Zorro leaves with the carriage, Hortensia holds onto the back to ride with him. Huerta and his men give chase. Zorro stops the carriage long enough to order Hortensia to leave, saying that the people need her. He kisses her, Hortensia leaves, and then Zorro drives the carriage off a cliff into the ocean. Hortensia looks over in disbelief, and Huerta arrives. Huerta says that now Nuova Aragon will have a new governor  and Hortensia, if her parents know what\\'s best for them, will have a husband. On the day of the wedding, Brother Francisco and civilians arrive at the church in protest. Huerta orders the guards to arrest him, but they are reluctant to do so. To everyone\\'s surprise , Zorro reappears unharmed. He battles soldiers on the roof of the church, while on the ground Kapitan von Markel assists the angry crowd in handling the soldiers. Huerta grabs a soldier\\'s pistol and shoots Brother Francisco at point-blank range, killing him and causing a riot to break out. Huerta\\'s armed soldiers settle the riot down, and Zorro, feeling that Brother Francisco\\'s murder has released him from his promise to Miguel de la Serna, begins a final showdown and duel to the death with Huerta. The fight goes on for many minutes, going from the doorstep of the church to the inside. During the duel Zorro repeats Huerta\\'s trick with the candles, only better—splitting one in half. Later on, Zorro falls out through a stained glass window and Huerta believes Zorro is dead. However, Zorro reappears in the darkness of the bell tower and the fight continues. In the meantime, the dog Assassin prevents Garcia from interfering, causing the fat sergeant to back into and fall down a well. On the roof, Huerta says that either he or Zorro must die. Zorro then says, \"Well then...let it be the moment of truth.\" and unmasks himself. In a simultaneous lunge, Diego kills Huerta, causing him to fall from the roof. The crowd looks on stunned, then bursts into applause. Zorro then appears in a valley on his horse, and in romantic fashion, rides off. The tyrant is dead. Justice has triumphed. Long live Zorro!',\n",

He befriends a woman who, still in the grip of the organization, works as a mole for him. This leads to many battles between 00 and the villain's henchmen. The plot shifts to Mr. Giant's true goal: using the N-Bomb. Created by Dr. Kohler, it is a weapon that does something that is never really explained. Always the company man, Agent 00 takes this story swing in stride and continues to fight the villains. One part early on has him sneaking up on people throughout, which is easy given that he exists just below most people's peripheral vision. Another has him taking on Samurai and with a conveniently-scaled katana sword.\",\n",

              " \"Chris McCormick  is a highly paid fashion model whose image serves as the driving force of the ad campaign for a popular brand of lipstick and can be seen in magazines and on billboards all around the world. Gordon Stuart , a part-time composer and full-time music teacher, eagerly accepts Chris’s 13-year-old sister Kathy’s  invitation to come to a secluded beachside photo shoot, so Chris can listen to some of his music. But Chris is too busy to give any of her time to Gordon and suggests that they meet another day at the apartment she shares with Kathy. Gordon agrees and shows up at the apartment at the date and time that she mentioned. Even though Chris has clearly forgotten about the invitation, she lets him in and politely sits down as he plays her a tape of one of his compositions. What she hears is not easy on her ears, but she smiles as it plays and pretends to appreciate it until a phone call from her lover, Steve Edison , thankfully interrupts them and allows her to escape to her room, away from the noise and the very creepy Gordon. As Chris talks to Steve, Gordon begins to fume at the thought of Chris’ obvious rejection. His hurt soon turns to anger and he enters her room and smashes a picture of her brother Martin , a priest, before throwing himself on top of her. During Chris's struggle to fight him off, Gordon slams her head against one of her bedposts and screams at her to show him where she keeps the lipstick that her face sells to the public. When she tells him it's in her bathroom, he takes her in there and smears it across her face, then forces her to perform fellatio on him to leave the traces of the lipstick on his genitalia. Returning her to her bed, he ties her down with silk scarves, and anally rapes her to the accompaniment of his discordant compositions. Near the end of the ordeal, Kathy returns home from school and walks in on Chris and Gordon, who Kathy has a crush on, together in bed -- hurt and embarrassed, Kathy runs out before they see her, and before she can tell what's really going on. Chris hears her leave, and asks Gordon to untie her. He gets up and suggests calling Kathy in to join them and “Have some fun,” but he instead cuts Chris free and leaves. Chris gets up, finds Kathy, and after telling her what really happened, Chris calls the police. Gordon is arrested, but as Chris learns from Carla Bondi , the prosecutor assigned to handle the case, Gordon's conviction is hardly a sure thing. Only two out of 100 rapists serve any jail time, and only 10,000 out of the 50,000 rapes that occur each year in California are reported to the police. If Chris wants justice, she’ll have to testify, and that could mean subjecting herself to a kind of abuse as terrible as the rape itself. Despite Steve’s fears of what a trial could do to her career, Chris agrees to testify passionately, informing everyone in the room that “I want him to die in jail! I want them to do it to him in jail!” Unfortunately for Chris, Carla’s worst fears are all realized. Gordon's attorney argues that the sex was consensual, and that its roughness was the result of Chris's own twisted desires and not Gordon's. He also suggests that even if Gordon acted without her consent, she provoked him by appearing naked in front of him at the photo shoot where they first met, and by the inherent sensuality of the photographs from which she makes her living. To Chris's enormous shock, the jury buys that logic and votes to acquit. Gordon walks out of the courthouse a free man. Not long after that, Chris learns that Steve, who works for the cosmetics company she poses for, has decided to “cool down” their ad campaign, meaning that she's been abandoned by Steve, and is soon going to be out of work. Not knowing what else to do, Chris decides to move to Colorado with Kathy as soon she finishes what is to be her last photo shoot. But by a terrible coincidence, Kathy’s old school is using the same building Chris’s shoot is in to rehearse the new ballet being orchestrated by Gordon. As Chris poses in a red sequined gown, Kathy runs into Gordon, who -- despite her protestations to the contrary -- a part of her still believes is innocent of what Chris accused him of. Kathy soon learns, however, that Chris wasn’t lying when Gordon’s intentions become sinister, and he starts chasing her throughout the nearly abandoned building. Eventually, he catches her, starts tearing at her clothes and rapes her. When Gordon is done with her, Kathy stumbles to the photo shoot and tells Chris what happened. Knowing she absolutely cannot trust the system to do what's right, Chris -- still wearing the red gown -- runs outside to her vehicle and grabs a pump-action shotgun that she had intended to take to Colorado with her. Chris spots Gordon driving his car in the parking lot, and shoots at it. Gordon is hit by a bullet. He tries running Chris over, but the car swirls and overturns on its side. With difficulty, Gordon climbs out of the car, and Chris shoots him in his chest, shoulder and stomach. Gordon falls out of the car. Chris comes near to the place where Gordon is writhing in pain. Convulsing, he tries hard getting up, but Chris shoots him between his legs, killing him instantly. Even after his death, Chris keeps shooting, while being haunted by the dirty memories of her ugly rape. Within seconds, the police arrive and arrest Chris. Later, Carla Bondi speaks to a jury, telling them that their acquittal of the devillish Gordon earlier resulted in Chris losing faith in the law and in order for the Los Angeles department of justice to not appear appallingly incompetent they have to acquit Chris. The Jury ultimately finds Chris not guilty.\",\n",

              " '{{plot}} The film opens on a long strand of beach, where several people in white robes gather around a young man named Ilius, adorning him in a vest of leather armor, while an old man hands him a bow and a set of arrows, summoning it to fly to them. The old man tells Ilius the tale of an ancient warrior god named Kronos, who once wielded the bow, and how when he ran out of arrows, the sun itself seemed to vanish from the sky, transferring itself to his bow, making arrows out of pure sunlight. After telling Ilius this tale, the old man and his people depart as Ilius wordlessly departs down the beach. We are then introduced to a powerful sorceress named Ohkren, a woman whose entire head is adorned in a golden mask as she recites a magical chant to make the sun rise before a large gathering of cave-dwelling people. However, it turns out that Ohkren is a sadistic, cruel witch who commands a savage army of wolfmen who quickly invade the caves of these people, slaying their leader, and grabbing a young woman who attempts to flee, and is graphically torn into quarters as Ohkren cracks her severed head open, seemingly devouring part of her brain. In a strange, dreamlike sequence, Ohkren and her wolfmen partake in hallucinogenic drugs when suddenly, a young man devoid of any facial features charges into their chamber, and dispatches Ohkren and the wolfmen with the same magic bow that was given to Ilius. It is then revealed that this was all part of a vision, as Ohkren fears a lone wanderer shall come to slay her. In a fog-filled murky swamp, a lone girl with skin covered in ash, is collecting water from the marshes when she is suddenly attacked by a group of masked men. But they are killed when Ilius arrives with his bow and arrows at the ready. Unfortunately, he soon runs out of arrows and tries to flee, a group of Ohkren\\'s wolfmen attack him, but just when it seems that Ilius will die, he is saved by a lone muscular man who easily fends off the attackers with a rock attached to a sling. The lone man reveals his name to be Mace, he offers to accompany Ilius in exchange for saving his life and if Ilius teaches him how to use the bow. Ohkren is quickly informed of her warriors\\' failure to kill Ilius, and she resolves to have him dead, no matter what it takes. Its revelaed that Mace has a sort of Beastmasterish type of power as he rescues a hawk and nurtures it back to health. Mace has developed a bit of talent with Ilius\\' bow and shows off by killing a lone caveman, for no apparent reason. They take shelter in a cave for the night, but as they sleep, Ohkren\\'s wolfmen trap the two heroes inside, blocking all the entrances with burning bushes. Ilius and Mace make an escape through a hole in the ground, but once again find themselves trapped. Fortunately, Ilius notices a snake on the ground slithering through a small hole in the cave wall, Mace fiugres they can get out the same way the snake did. The two quickly break through the thin stone wall and make their escape. This failure is again noticed by Ohkren when she has another vision of the faceless warrior. As punishment, she tortures the leader of her wolfmen to death, and quickly summons a being dressed in plated armor skirt and a plated mask named Zora, who swears that he shall kill the wanderer for her. As Ilius and Mace continue their travels, they come across a small tribe of the cave people, who are apparently familiar with Mace, and invite them in for the night. During the feast they hold, Ilius recognizes one of the girls in the tribe as the girl he saved in the swamps, who has taken a strong liking to him. In the dead of night as the others sleep, the girl takes Ilius to the outside of the cave in an attempt to have sex with him, but Ohkren\\'s warriors have tracked down Ilius and Mace and viciously slaughter the girl and all her people. Ilius is dragged away by the attackers as Mace is knocked out in the attack. When he awakens, Mace resolves to rescue Ilius, as he has come to accept Ilius as his one friend. He manages to find the band of Ohkren\\'s warriors with Ilius in tow as they have all made camp for the night. Mace swiftly dispatches several of the warriors as he frees Ilius, who manages to grab his magic bow and help Mace slay the rest of their enemies. At this point, Ilius finally explains to Mace that he is on a quest to slay the evil sorceress Ohkren, and put an end to her reign of terror over the people of the land. Although Mace tries to convince Ilius to go back to his land, as Ohkren is too powerful, Ilius refuses to go home until his task is complete. Mace eventually decides that he shall aid Ilius in any way he can, but he still feels that this is a fools errand, as no man has ever managed to slay Ohkren yet. After inexplicably building a raft and then abandoning it. Mace and Ilius travel through an open field, Mace notices that he and Ilius have wandered into an area with some sort of sentient plant. The plant soon reveals its predatory nature by firing a massive rain of quills in order to kill them. Realizing they don\\'t stand a chance, Mace and Ilius try to run to safer ground. They soon reach the small beach where they abandoned their raft, but Ilius is suddenly shot in the leg with a quill, which was coated with an extremely deadly poison which manifests itself in boils that ooze blood and pus. They depart the beach via the raft, but with Ilius growing more and more ill, Mace brings the raft to a small island, where he explains that there are some special plants that could heal the ailment. Mace rushes off to the heart of the island where he soon enters a dark and foreboding swamp. He quickly locates the plant, but as he makes his way back to Ilius, he is attacked by a large band of zombies. Upon discovering that they can be killed by impalment, he dispatches a few and manages to escape the rest. Mace returns to Ilius, who begs him to hurry and end his pain, but to his surprise, Mace grabs a large rock, preparing to kill him with it, but he is suddenly attacked by another Mace. The two warriors clash until one Mace manages to pin the other to the sand with a large branch. The pinned Mace laughs and reveals himself to be Zora, the plated skirt spirit that Ohkren had summoned, just before he disappears into thin air. Although shaken by the encounter, Mace quickly makes the healing plant into a paste through the night and administers it to Ilius\\' wounds, effectively terminating the poison from the arrow. With Ilius fully recovered, he decides to continue on his journey to kill Ohkren, but this time, Mace refuses to go with him, as he is not willing to die for a task that cannot be done. Although disappointed, Ilius decides to respect his friends wish and offers his bow to Mace as a gift. Mace refuses, stating that the bow has brought too much pain and death to too many people since their adventure started. Ilius then rows off to sea with the raft as Mace departs back the way they came. As Mace travels along the rocky coast, he is soon ambushed by a band of white furry creatures. They demand to know where Ilius is and when he refuses to reveal that information they tie him to a wooden \"X\" one the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile, Ilius realizes that he can\\'t abandon his friend nor can he continue alone. Ilius returns to the coast that the creatures dwell near and spots Mace and quickly realizes the predicament. Ilius attacks the creatures with his magic bow, harnessing the sun arrows power at last as he is no longer afraid of the dangers that await him, unlocking his true potential. However, he is unable to prevent one last survivor of the creatures from pushing Mace off the cliff into the sea below. Mace sinks to the bottom of the sea and is unable to free himself as he is tied to the cross, and nearly drowns, but he uses his animal power and calls two dolphins who half heartedly save him. Ilius, despondent over Mace\\'s death or his own culpability in Mace\\'s demise, is relieved to find him on the beach and resuscitates him. In gratitude for saving his life, Mace agrees to stay with Ilius for the remainder of their journey. Making camp in another cave, Ilius is soon dragged under the ground by some sort of creature. As he loses his bow, he isn\\'t able to put up a fight and is last seen being drug into the dark. Mace is awakened by Ilius\\'s cries and jumps into the hole after him. Mace, unable to see clearly, manages to fight off a few of the creatures, until he is overpowered and thrown into a small pit. Mace soon awakens a horde of bats inside the cave, and in the madness of their whole swarm flying around him, Mace notices a blue bat who seems to guide him through a small tunnel that he can use to escape. He reaches the exit, but his elation is deflated as he soon notices blood dripping on him. Upon glancing up, he notices Ilius hanging upside down from the ceiling of the cave, decapitated. Zora is then shown in Ohkren\\'s chamber, carrying Ilius\\' severed head in his hand, as Ohkren rejoices at having destroyed the one who would kill her. Her victory is cut short when she sees the head open its eyes and realizes that though Ilius\\'s body may be dead, his soul lives and that for as long as it does she remains in danger. Back in the caves, Mace has built a funeral pyre for Ilius. As he stands at his side, Mace hears Ilius\\' voice, telling him that with his death, he passes the powers he inherited from Kronos unto Mace. When the fire dies down, Mace rubs the ashes of Ilius onto his skin, personally resolving to finish Ilius\\' quest, and to slay Ohkren for him. On the cliff where Ohkren was first shown raising the sun, she is once again reciting the sun chant, surrounded by her remaining soldiers and Zora. She is suddenly interrupted Mace, who announces that he has come to avenge Ilius and that this day, the sun shall rise without Ohkren. Stretching out his hand, Mace is now able to summon forth the bow just as the old man did in the beginning. With newfound resolve and courage, Mace easily slaughters the rest of Ohkren\\'s soldiers. Zora takes off leaving Ohkren to die. She quickly flees by teleporting into her chamber, however, Mace undaunted fires an arrow that goes through the mountain and knocks her mask off. When Mace arrives in Ohkren\\'s chamber, the sorceress rises, revealing her face to be that of a rotted zombie, but apparently blinded as she is unable to find Mace. Knowing Ilius\\' task is close to an end, Mace fires one final arrow into Ohkren\\'s heart, seemingly slaying the sorceress. However, she is later seen in her wolf form running off with Zora, who has also returned to his wolf form. The cave people, and the people across the land take notice of the change brought on by Ohkren\\'s death, and the film ends as Mace departs from the cave, walking off into the distant sunrise with Ilius\\' bow strapped to his back, finally at peace that he has avenged his friend, and finished what he started.',\n",

Menda's aide Francisco  is also in town, and unknown to Menda he is actually a prime-mover in the assassination plot, keeping close to Menda while duplicitously passing on information to the would-be killers. Not only is Francisco an unsuspected political arch-rival, but he is also keeping an eye on Menda's glamorous wife Carla , with whom he fancies his chances once Menda is out of the way. Meanwhile, English surgeon Bob McLaurin  is under pressure from nagging, dissatisfied wife Margaret , who wants him to give up his job in Canada and move back to England to open a private cosmetic surgery for the wealthy, where he could at least double his income.

The worry causes Bob to lose concentration during Menda's operation, and he almost makes a fatal slip-up. However in the end the operation is a complete success.

              " 'The opening titles set the film in \"North America – 1991.\" Armando  explains that in 1983 , a disease killed the world\\'s cats and dogs, leaving humans with no pets. To replace them, humans began keeping apes as household pets. Realizing the apes\\' capacity to learn and adapt, humans train them to perform household tasks. By 1991, American culture is based on ape slave labor. Armando and Caesar , a young chimpanzee horseback rider in Armando\\'s circus, distribute flyers around a large city to advertise the circus\\' arrival. Armando warns the chimpanzee to be careful; should anyone learn his identity as the son of Cornelius and Zira, it would mean their deaths. They see apes performing various menial tasks, and are shocked at the harsh discipline on disobedient apes. Seeing an ape being beaten and drugged, Caesar shouts, \"Lousy human bastards!\" Quickly, Armando takes responsibility for the exclamation, explaining to the policemen that it was he who shouted, not his chimpanzee. The surrounding crowd becomes agitated, and Caesar flees. Hiding in a stairway, Armando tells Caesar he will go to the authorities and bluff his way out of the situation. Meantime, Caesar has to hide among his own kind  and soon finds himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He is then sold at auction to Governor Breck ([[Don Murray . Breck allows the ape to name himself by randomly pointing to a word in a book handed to him and the chimpanzee\\'s finger rests upon the name \"Caesar\", feigning coincidence. Caesar is then put to work by Breck\\'s chief aide, MacDonald , who sympathizes with the apes to the thinly veiled disgust of his boss. MacDonald eventually figures out who Caesar really is. Meanwhile, Armando is being interrogated by Inspector Kolp , who suspects his \"circus ape\" is the child of the two talking apes from the future. Kolp\\'s assistant puts Armando under an authenticator machine that psychologically forces people to be truthful. Rather than confessing, Armando fights the guard and jumps through a window, falling to his death. Learning of the death of his foster father, the only human that cared for him, Caesar loses faith in human kindness and begins plotting a rebellion. Secretly, Caesar teaches combat to other apes and has them gather weapons. Meanwhile, Breck learns from Kolp that the vessel which supposedly delivered Caesar is from a region with no native chimpanzees. Suspecting Caesar is the ape the police are hunting, Breck\\'s men arrest Caesar and electrically torture him until he speaks. Hearing him speak, Breck orders Caesar\\'s immediate death. Caesar survives his execution because MacDonald lowers the machine\\'s electrical output well below lethal levels. Once Breck leaves, Caesar kills his torturer and escapes. Caesar leads an ape revolt against Ape Management. The apes are victorious after killing most of the riot police. After bursting into Breck\\'s command post and killing most of the personnel, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed. MacDonald is spared, and he appeals to Caesar to show mercy to his former persecutor. Caesar ignores him, and in a rage declares: {{quote}} As the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Lisa , Caesar\\'s love interest, voices her objection, \"NO!\" She is the first ape to speak other than Caesar.

              " 'In 1992, ITN reporter Michael Henderson  travels to Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn  on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures. Henderson and Flynn have friendly arguments and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto  to be Henderson\\'s translator. Their work permits them blunt and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from an orphanage located on the front lines  in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly brutal attacks fail to make the lead story in England, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war. When American aid worker Nina  organizes a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of several orphaned Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces Nina to include a Bosniak girl from the orphanage, Emira , to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act -- Emira\\'s mother is still alive and signed no papers authorizing the evacuation -- but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story. Despite a UN escort, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. The final harassment is the worst -- a group of Chetniks halt the bus, forcibly disembark the Bosnian Serb children and put them on their armed lorry, presumably to repatriate them. When Henderson finally makes it to London with Emira, Emira quickly becomes a member of Henderson\\'s family in a comfortable London home. After an ambiguous interval of perhaps 100 days, Henderson receives word from his former producer, who is still in Sarajevo, that Emira\\'s mother wants Emira back. Henderson returns to Sarajevo, now riven not only by the siege but also by internal organized crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian-Herzegovinan soldier. Henderson recruits Risto to find Emira\\'s mother. They nearly succeed, but the unstable situation unravels around them and they are forced to retreat. When Risto is killed by a sniper in his own home, Henderson falls back on Zeljko , a concierge at the Holiday Inn who Henderson had helped in previous Sarajevo tours. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira\\'s mother. As prelude to signing the adoption papers, she outlines the reasons she wants Emira back. She cannot in good conscience bring Emira back to Sarajevo, though, and she signs the papers. A running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that \"the people will die happily listening to my music.\" The movie ends with Harun holding a \"concert of peace\" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajeva had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth. The closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.',\n",

Jonas has become morose after hearing that China is developing an atomic bomb. Tomas speaks to the man briefly, but asks Jonas to return after taking his wife home. No sooner have the Perssons left than Märta enters, attempts to comfort the miserable Tomas, and asks if he\\'s read the letter she wrote to him. He hasn\\'t. Tomas tells her of his failure to help Jonas, and wonders if he will have anything to say, since he is without hope as well. Märta states her love for Tomas, but also her belief that he doesn\\'t love her. She leaves, and Tomas reads her letter. In an unbroken shot lasting almost six minutes, Bergman has Märta face the camera and speak the contents of the letter. In it, she coldly attacks Tomas for his neglect of her, relating a story of how a rash that disfigured her body repulsed him, and neither his faith nor his prayers did anything to help her. Tomas finishes the letter, and falls asleep. Awakened by the return of Jonas, Tomas clumsily tries to provide counsel, before finally admitting that he has no faith as well. He tells the depressed man that his  faith was an egotistical one – God loved humanity, but Tomas most of all. Serving in Lisbon during the Spanish Civil War, Tomas could not reconcile his loving God with the atrocities being committed, so he ignored them. Tomas finally tells Jonas that things make more sense if we deny the existence of God, because then man\\'s cruelty needs no explanation. Jonas leaves, and Tomas faces the crucifix and declares himself finally free. Märta, who has been lurking in the chapel, is overjoyed to hear this, and embraces Tomas . They are interrupted by the widow Magdalena, who tells them that Jonas has just committed suicide with a rifle. Tomas drives, alone, to the scene. Shot in an awkward, distant style , Tomas stoically helps the police cover Jonas\\'s body with a tarp, then stands guard while waiting for the \"van\" to collect the body, which arrives shortly. Märta arrives on foot, and she and Tomas drive off to her home, where she invites him in to take some medicine for his cold. Waiting in the classroom attached to her house , Tomas finally lashes out at her, telling her first that he rejected her because he was tired of the gossip about them. When that fails to deter her affections, Tomas then tells her that he was tired of her constant talking, and that Märta could never measure up to his late wife, the only woman he has ever loved. Though shocked by the attack, Märta agrees to drive with him to the Persson house. Informed of Jonas\\'s suicide, Karin collapses onto the stairs and wonders how she and her children will go on. Tomas makes a perfunctory offer of help, and leaves. Arriving for the 3 o\\'clock service at the second church, Tomas and Märta find the building empty except for Algot, the hunchbacked sexton, and Fredrik, the organist . Fredrik tells Märta that she should leave the small town and Tomas and live her life, rather than stay and have her dreams crushed like the rest of them. Meanwhile in the vestry, Algot questions Tomas about the Passion. Algot wonders why so much emphasis was placed on the physical suffering of Jesus, which was brief, versus the many betrayals he faced from his disciples  and finally from God, who did not answer him on the cross. He asks, \"Wasn\\'t God\\'s silence worse?\" Tomas, who has been listening silently, answers yes. Fredrik and Algot wonder if they should have a service since no one showed up, but Tomas replies that someone has shown up: Märta. Tomas begins the service as the film ends.',\n",

Peter contradicts her: he has left his hospital service and transferred to the RAF to learn to fly. After hearing his story, Steve agrees to keep Peter in training. On his first leave from duty, Peter meets Kay Saunders and is immediately infatuated. She dates Peter, but warns him that she might still be in love with Steve. Still, her instincts warn her that Steve would make a poor husband: he seems a carefree nomad not interested in settling down. Peter admires Steve and is grateful to him, so he warns Steve that he is in love with Kay and intends to propose marriage. Steve promises that he won\\'t wash out Peter because of their rivalry. His judgment tells him that Peter will one day be a fine pilot. Squadron Leader Barrett gives Peter a check flight and he gets sick again. Steve stands by Peter in a showdown, threatening to resign. Gramps throws a Fourth of July party for the cadets and, to help Steve win Kay, tricks Peter into riding a bucking bronco. This backfires when Peter proves to be an adept horseman. Steve sees that Kay has fallen in love with Peter, even before she realizes it herself. The decision on Peter\\'s training must be made. Steve tells Peter to fly the plane just as he rode the bronco, by easing up and relaxing. The advice works. Steve then forces Peter to fly solo by bailing out! But he descends into a sandstorm and is blown along the ground toward a cliff. Peter lands nearby and saves Steve, but the wind flips his airplane over before they can return to it. Mac believes that Peter\\'s incompetence caused the damage, washes him out, and fires Steve. Kay tricks Mac and Barrett into giving them one more chance. She tells Steve that she has decided to marry Peter, and reminds him of his own words about where the war will be won. Peter makes good on the faith shown in him, making a deadstick landing when his engine fails during his solo. Soon after, Steve, hobbling on a cane, greets an incoming class of new RAF cadets.',\n",

              " '11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking this perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins, as we interweave her story with another… Far away, a brilliant research geneticist at UC Berkeley named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science magazine -- quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees.King, M-C. and Wilson, A.C. \"Evolution at two levels in humans and chimpanzees.\" Science 188, 107-116 . But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at last some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough -- the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene -- considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth centuryKevin Davies and Michael White. \"Breakthrough: The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene.\" . and touch thousands of lives, including that of a young woman living thousands of miles away, named Anne Parker. At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Anne’s sister contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she too is dead. Married, with a child, and only in her 20’s, Anne Parker’s challenges have hardly begun. She herself is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe and surgery and chemotherapy with all its accompanying difficulties soon follows. She loses her hair and if that was that enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne’s closest friend, and leaves her, shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. And this is where many stories would end; with tragedy of unimaginable anguish and an almost surreal relentlessness, but Anne Parker is not an ordinary woman and hers is not an ordinary story. With the help of a young doctor, Sean, and a new friend, Kim, Anne continues her fight. As each tragedy befalls her, something remarkable happens. She grows stronger. As each new sadness comes, she grows more resolved; as her world becomes darker, she becomes, well… funnier. So funny that she makes other patients laugh. So funny her doctors are far more serious about her illness than she is. So positive, that she becomes a life force onto herself, determined to survive it all. And something else —- she believes that she must find the genetic secret that hid in her family and had killed almost all of them. It becomes the focus of her considerable energies. While Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite \"the disappeared\" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in Science magazine a short time later.Hall, J.M. et al. \"Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21.\" Science 250, 1684-89 . Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time magazine; and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. This same Anne Parker, now happily remarried, who a few years later would contract cancer for a third time. And she would survive again. And she laughed while being treated, for reasons only she knew and understood. Anne Parker still lives a full life to this day.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Decoding-Annie-Parker/218537534833277?sk=info',\n",

After witnessing an extraordinary demonstration of Clayton\\'s computer skills, Burke further tests the intelligence of Clayton with an open puzzle encoded on the sports page of a common newspaper, the solution of which gives to Clayton Burke\\'s telephone number. Clayton agrees to be recruited, in part, to find information concerning his father who he suspects was a CIA operative that disappeared when Clayton was a child. After passing numerous psychometric, psychoanalytical, aptitude, and polygraph tests, Clayton is taken to The Farm, a CIA training facility. There, Burke and other instructors teach the candidates the skill sets of espionage, covert operation protocols, and intelligence gathering techniques. During a surveillance exercise, Clayton and fellow recruit Layla Moore  are kidnapped by men apparently from a foreign intelligence service. Clayton is brought to an isolated cell and tortured for several days but refuses to give up the names of his CIA instructors. When the interrogators provide evidence that his defiance is contributing to Layla\\'s suffering, Clayton relents and names Burke. The rear wall of the cell then opens to reveal Burke, Layla, and the other recruits sitting in the lecture theater at The Farm, having witnessed the entire event; the kidnapping being just another training exercise. Clayton is cut from the program, but Burke arrives at his hotel the next morning to advise Clayton his dismissal was a fake and he has been appointed to be a non-official cover  operative. Burke assigns Clayton to spy on Layla, claiming the CIA has evidence she\\'s a mole for a foreign intelligence service attempting to steal a top secret computer virus from the CIA\\'s database. Clayton is provided a job as a low-level CIA data-entry processor and enters a romantic relationship with Layla. He eventually uncovers proof that she is removing the virus piece-by-piece using a USB flash drive. Clayton surveils Layla as she brush-passes a note to her contact and follows the man through a train station. After a brief scuffle, Clayton kills him and discovers the contact is Zack , a CIA agent who had also been a recruit at The Farm. When confronted with the evidence, Layla explains to Clayton she was officially sanctioned to test the security protocols of CIA headquarters by attempting to remove a fake virus, and Zack was a NOC agent. Clayton, by virtue of his familiarity with computer programs, is skeptical and reports his suspicions to Burke who initially congratulates Clayton on passing \"the final test.\" Burke is caught in a lie, however, when he tries to convince Clayton his gun is loaded with blanks. Clayton fires a shot proving otherwise but flees when Burke knocks the gun from his grip. Burke then chases Clayton through an abandoned warehouse, and boasts that he organized the entire scheme to sell the virus for $3 million. Held at gunpoint, Clayton agrees to hand over the virus, only to show that he has been broadcasting Burke\\'s admission from his laptop back to CIA headquarters. Burke becomes incensed and chases Clayton outside to find a SWAT team had assembled. Unbeknownst to Burke, Clayton\\'s broadcast did not work and a fake broadcast was displayed. The CIA were there to arrest Clayton and had no knowledge of Burke\\'s treachery. Believing to be caught, Burke rails at his unjust treatment by the CIA, allowing the agents to conclude that Burke is the traitor. Burke then realizes he incriminated himself and draws his gun; committing suicide-by-cop. Afterward, Layla consoles Clayton before he heads back to CIA headquarters for debriefing. On the drive to Langley, Virginia, Assistant Director of Operations Dennis Slayne  makes a comment alluding that Clayton\\'s father was a NOC agent when he died.',\n",

The pair drive upstate into the teeth of a raging snow storm. When they arrive at the home of Dr. Joseph Lewis , he graciously greets Katie from his wheelchair. He gives her a tour of the house, which features a number of trophies from his hunting days, including two massive stuffed polar bears. Katie asks to use the phone to call Rob but finds it has no dial tone. Dr. Lewis explains that the storm must have downed the lines and that Mr. Murray would drive her into town in the morning to make her call if they were still down. Over dinner, Dr. Lewis explains that Katie has been hired to replace Julie Rose, an actress who had a nervous breakdown during a film shoot. Katie is stunned to see photos of Julie, exclaiming, \"I could be her sister!\" Dr. Lewis explains that they will shoot a test reel on videotape tomorrow, which the director will view when he arrives. The following day, Mr. Murray tries to drive Katie into town to make her phone call, but his car will not start. Mr. Murray then cuts and dyes Katie\\'s hair to match the photos of Julie. Katie asks him how he met Dr. Lewis. Mr. Murray explains that Dr. Lewis was his psychiatrist. The shoot goes well. Katie\\'s lines are all about the attack seen at the beginning of the film. That evening, Mr. Murray sneaks out of the house and reconnects the car\\'s ignition. He drives to another house nearby where a woman, whose face is never shown, watches him from her window. He slips the videotape into her mail slot, and she watches the video of Katie. After the test reel footage, Dr. Lewis appears on the video to tell the viewer that they need to meet. The next morning, as Katie looks for Dr. Lewis she stumbles upon a notebook with Polaroids of Julie\\'s corpse. Horrified, she confronts Dr. Lewis with the evidence.

Later that day in the parlor, Katie is startled by a pop in the fireplace, where she sees her driver\\'s license burning. Unable to retrieve it, she rushes to her room and sees that all of her ID is missing from her wallet. As night falls, Katie sneaks out of the house without a coat. She tries to steal the car, but it is locked. The weather is so ferocious that she ends up crawling to the top of a hill where, to her horror, Mr. Murray is waiting for her. Back at the house, she demands to know what is going on. Dr. Lewis pretends her imagination is running wild. Katie realizes that Mr. Murray has drugged her hot chocolate, and she returns to her room, barricading the door with a mound of furniture before she passes out. As she sleeps, Mr. Murray enters her room from behind her full-length mirror. Katie wakes up in a fresh sleeping gown with a bandaged hand. She peels off the bandages to find that her left ring finger has been removed. Seeing that her barricade is undisturbed, Katie quickly finds the door behind the mirror and sees a staircase to the attic, which has a working phone. She calls Rob and explains that they are going to kill her. Rob asks where she is, but Katie can only remember vague landmarks about the drive upstate. Rob orders her to hang up the phone and call the police, which she does. As she collapses on a sofa, she sees the body of Julie Rose. Mr. Murray arrives and rips the handset out of the phone, taking her back downstairs to Dr. Lewis. As Dr. Lewis redresses her finger, he explains that Julia was involved in a vicious family feud with her sister, Evelyn. As a radical therapy, Dr. Lewis had convinced her to blackmail her sister, theorizing that it would help her achieve a catharsis. He was pleased with Julie\\'s progress, but did not expect Evelyn to kill her, ordering the hit man to take her finger as proof. During his explanation, the police arrive. Dr. Lewis has just sedated Katie, and the combination of the sedative which confuses Katie and Dr. Lewis\\' claim that she is his patient convince the police to leave without much of an investigation. Meanwhile, Rob and Roland have begun to drive upstate, using the handful of clues they have to try to locate Katie. When Katie wakes again, Evelyn is standing over her. Dr. Lewis is displaying Katie to prove that Julie is still alive and continue the blackmail. Katie slowly emerges from the sedative as Mr. Murray returns her to her room. Awake again, she fakes an escape attempt, luring Dr. Lewis and Mr. Murray out of the house. She pleads with Evelyn to help her escape, but Evelyn is convinced she is really Julie and attacks her. Katie kills Evelyn and poses as her to try to escape. When Mr. Murray realizes the ruse, Katie stabs him in the neck. Dr. Lewis is also not fooled by the disguise and lunges out of his wheelchair at Katie. Using a fire poker as a crutch, he follows her upstairs and eventually into the attic, where Katie manages to kill him.

Ambika looks after the business after their parents died while Radha is a student. Kamal meets Radha and soon they fall in love with each other while Ambika has sworn off all men.Jaishankar is their uncle who is after their wealth. When Radha brings Kamal home to meet her sister, both Kamal and Ambika have a big fight which ends is Ambika forbidding Radha from seeing Kamal ever again. Ambika then reveals the reason behind the fight. Years earlier, Kamal and Ambika were classmates and Ambika had a crush on him which Kamal never reciprocated. While on a class trip, Ambika gives a note to Kamal that asks him to meet her in his room. Ambika claims that, that night, Kamal entered her room and both had consensual sex, but Kamal denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison. But soon the truth comes out. During the class trip, Kamal never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj kumar, who was also their classmate. Raj, lusting after Ambika, uses this opportunity to enter Ambika’s room on the pretext of being Kamal and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Ambika didn’t know the difference. Kamal, forgives Ambika and gets back with Radha while the bad guys are punished. The movie paired Ambika and her real-life sister Radha in roles of sisters on-screen. Nadia was first offered the role of the younger sister. She refused it and the role went to Radha. The two sisters delivered stunning performances that are fondly remembered by a generation of fans. Ambika played the role of a young and beautiful, yet strong and single woman with aplomb. In this role she plays a dominating business tycoon with a powerful personality. She portrays a controlling and protective older sister for younger Radha, while simultaneously demonstrating a highly glamorous and desirable personality herself. Very soon, in a flashback, she displays a totally different personality as a pretty and carefree college girl, switching between the two roles effortlessly. The director does a beautiful job of selecting scenes that portray all the varying aspects of Ambika's varied persona in the movie, such as a scene that puts her in a corporate boss role, a scene that has her questioning her sister protectively, a scene that shows her caring side in a poor children's home and a scene that underscores her youth and physical beauty in the dressing room. Radha also looks her best in the movie, an actress at the height of her commercial success, totally confident and comfortable about pairing up with her more experienced sister. She refuses to be overshadowed by her elder sister in the movie and comes across as a distinct and talented actress. This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.\",\n",

His extraordinary devotion attracts the attention of the Sheikh of an Istanbul Sufi order who offers him an administrative post as a manager for the seminary properties that support a school for orphans and poor children. Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith. The Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him. However, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat  beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh. The film ends with him experiencing an excellently portrayed crisis of spirit, driven by his inner piousness clashing against the jarring change he sees in himself, brought upon by his new job that thrust him unprepared into the modern world. He ends up catatonic in bed, being cared for by the woman of his dreams, yet completely oblivious to her presence.\",\n",

When Aladar is an adult, the island is destroyed when an asteroid crashes on earth, causing a meteor shower, with only Aladar, his grandfather Yar, his mother Plio, his best friend Zini and his sister Suri surviving the destruction of the island by swimming to the land After fleeing a pack of Velociraptor, the family meets a multi-species herd of dinosaurs  led by the Iguanodon Kron and his lieutenant Bruton, who are on a journey to reach the \"Nesting Grounds\", a valley believed to be untouched by the devastation of the asteroid impact. Aladar and the lemurs befriend a trio of elderly dinosaurs: Baylene the Brachiosaurus, Eema the Styracosaurus, and Url, Eema\\'s dog-like pet Ankylosaurus. Aladar also develops romantic feelings for Kron\\'s sister Neera, but she is uninterested. Meanwhile, the Velociraptor pack continues to follow them, but are scared off when a pair of Carnotaurs picks up the herd\\'s trail too. The herd arrives at a lake they’ve relied on for past trips, but it has dried up. Aladar saves the herd from dehydration when he and Baylene eventually dig up the trapped water beneath the ground. Aladar and Neera eventually fall in love after Neera sees Aladar helping the dinosaurs  survive. However, Bruton, having been sent by Kron to find water upon arrival at the lake, returns injured by the Carnotaur which killed another Iguanodon that was scouting with him. Kron evacuates the herd from the lake bed in a rush, leaving Aladar, the lemurs, the elderly dinosaurs, and the injured Bruton behind.

The local police dismiss her story as the ramblings of a senile and bored old woman, so, undaunted, she conducts her own investigation, and comes to the conclusion that the body must be buried on the grounds of Ackenthorpe Hall, which adjoins the railway line. Wheedling her way into a job as housemaid there, Marple copes with the pompous machinations of her difficult employer, Luther Ackenthorpe , so she can search for the mysterious corpse, and eventually finds it while supposedly practicing her golf shots. As she begins collecting suspects, accompanied by her long suffering companion Jim Stringer , Miss Marple finds herself faced with an increasingly devious and resourceful killer, who begins casting his shadow over Ackenthorpe's heirs...  In Christie's original story, an elderly character called Elspeth McGillicuddy witnessed the murder, not her friend Miss Marple, who wasn't introduced until later. As with most of her appearances in the role, Margaret Rutherford's flamboyant, comical portrayal of the sleuth was quite different from Christie's languid, passive depiction. The tone of the novel was also changed somewhat; instead of Christie's trademark suspense and underlying darkness, the film relied heavily on light, even whimsical comedy of manners. The name of the manor house where Marple conducts her inquiries was called Rutherford Hall in the novel, and was changed to Ackenthorpe in the film to avoid comparison with the leading actress' surname.\",\n",

              " 'The President of the United States  nominates Robert A. Leffingwell  as United States Secretary of State. The second-term President, who is ill, has chosen him because he does not believe that Vice President Harley Hudson &mdash;whom both he and others usually ignore&mdash;will successfully continue the administration\\'s foreign policy should he die. Leffingwell\\'s nomination is controversial within the United States Senate which, using its advice and consent powers, must either approve or reject the appointment. Both the President\\'s party, the majority, and the minority are divided. Majority Leader Bob Munson , the senior senator from Michigan, loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard working Majority Whip Stanley Danta  of Connecticut and womanizer Lafe Smith  of Rhode Island. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman  of Wyoming is especially supportive. Although also of the majority party, President pro tempore and \"curmudgeon\" Seabright \"Seeb\" Cooley  of South Carolina dislikes Leffingwell for both personal and professional reasons, and leads the opposition. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee appoints a subcommittee, chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson ([[Don Murray  of Utah, to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman . The minor Treasury clerk testifies that he was briefly in a Communist cell with Leffingwell and two others at the University of Chicago. Leffingwell denies the charge and effectively questions Gelman\\'s credibility, but later tells the President that he had committed perjury and that Gelman was essentially correct. He asks the President to withdraw his nomination, but he refuses. Cooley identifies another member of the cell, senior Treasury official Hardiman Fletcher. He forces him to confess to Anderson, who tells Munson. Despite personal lobbying by the President, the subcommittee chairman insists that the White House withdraw the nomination due to Leffingwell\\'s perjury or he will subpoena Fletcher to testify. The President angrily refuses but the majority leader admits that the White House will soon have to nominate another candidate. Anderson delays his committee\\'s report on Leffingwell but the President sends Fletcher out of the country, angering the senator. Anderson and his wife  receive anonymous phone calls from Van Ackerman\\'s men warning that, unless the subcommittee reports favorably on Leffingwell, information about what happened with \"Ray\" in Hawaii will appear. A worried Anderson visits a fellow Army veteran, Ray Shaff, in New York. Shaff admits that he sold evidence of a past homosexual relationship between the two. Hudson, Anderson\\'s friend Smith, and others attempt to counsel the troubled chairman but, unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson commits suicide. The President denies to Munson and Hudson knowing about the blackmail. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell\\'s confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher, forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson\\'s death, nonetheless, permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate. In the Senate Chamber Cooley apologizes for his \"vindictiveness\". While he will vote against Leffingwell and his \"alien voice\", the senator will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley\\'s action, cites the \"tragic circumstances\" surrounding the confirmation. Although the majority leader will vote for Leffingwell, he will permit a conscience vote from others. Hudson\\'s quorum call and the majority leader\\'s refusal to yield the floor prevent Van Ackerman from speaking, and Munson asks for the \"Yeas and Nays\", ending debate. The majority leader tells the senator that were it not for the Andersons\\' privacy the Senate would censure and expel him. Van Ackerman angrily leaves the chamber before the vote. Munson\\'s side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell and the majority leader prepares for the Vice President to break the tie in the nominee\\'s favor. Secret Service agents enter the chamber and Hudson receives a message from the Senate Chaplain. He announces that he will not break the tie, causing the nomination to fail, and that the President has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own Secretary of State. The film ends as Munson makes a motion to adjourn due to the former president\\'s death.',\n",

              " \"{{plot}} The film opens with a scene of people giving police complaints of the same fraud. Police broadcast the picture of the suspect on TV. Elsewhere, Annamalai  is arrested by the police in a hospital after being injured in a bus accident, under the charges of cheating and marrying four women with false identities. The four victims also confirm after seeing Annamalai that he was the one who cheated them. Annamalai is produced in the court where the judge  offers him a free lawyer owing to his inability to pay for one, but he prefers to argue his own case. Proceedings start as Rekha  is produced as the first witness. She explains how she came into contact with a rich man from London called Vignesh and how he charmed her. A friend of Vignesh called Napolean informs Rekha that Vignesh's parents want him to come to London in two days to make him marry a rich young woman. Rekha suggests that they both marry next day without much formality, so as to prevent marriage with the London girl. After marrying her, Vignesh cheats Rekha's brother Tyagu, a construction company owner, of Rs.25 lakhs intended as bribe for a government minister by acting as a middle-man between Tyagu and the minister in obtaining licence for a construction tender. He also decamps with Rekha's jewels worth Rs.40 lakhs next day after the marriage. However, Vignesh had postponed marriage registration and formal invitation printing owing to his apparent urgency to go to London. He also wanted the photographer to take the wedding photos in his personal digital camera saying he will send the prints from London. Annamalai argues that since there was no proof of a marriage between Vignesh and Rekha in terms of photos or registration, she cannot accuse him of cheating him; he states that he is not Vignesh. He, in turn, accuses Rekha's brother of trying to bribe the minister of Rs.25 lakhs. The fingerprints analyzed on the suitcases were found not to match with Annamalai's prints. The next victim is Ammu Kutty  from Cochin. She meets Madhavan Menon who helps lift up her picnic car when it was stuck in a hole. Then regular meetings passed and both started to love each other. When Ammu Kutty's family decide to marry her to a man in her relations, Ammu Kutty and Madhavan elope with her jewels. Napoleon then calls Ammu Kutty and says Madhavan has to pay Rs.10 lakhs deposit regarding a tea estate business; today is the last date. Ammu Kutty also learns from Napolean that Madhavan is the son of the sister of Kerala's chief minister. Madhavan says he doesn't have that much money. Ammu then gives him all her jewels for this. Madhavan hesitates but later takes it and goes to pay the deposit. But he doesn't return. Someone informs her family of her location and they come and drag Ammu Kutty to her house. Annamalai then cross questions Ammu Kutty. He says it's her fault to have chosen a husband without even knowing properly who he was. When he asks for her thali , she says she threw it away in anger. Annamalai states that the thali should not be disrespected like this and hence she is lying. He repeats that he is not the criminal. Meanwhile, Anjali, the daughter of the judge who was watching the case from the beginning recalls how the criminal cheated her. Anjali met Zakir Hussain at an art gallery and they started to love each other. Anjali wanted to buy one of his paintings. Zakir agreed to bring the covered Rs.1 lakh painting to her house. Zakir entices Anjali by proposing to her and leaving for Hyderabad on work. When Anjali opens the painting, it is revealed to be a blank sheet. Anjali then goes to the art gallery where she meets the real Zakir Hussain who says that there was a man whose name was also Zakir Hussain who was a fan of his art. After this incident, Anjali develops an affinity toward Annamalai, still believing him to be the man who cheated her cleverly. The police then perform a narco analysis and lie detector test on Annamalai without success. A man called David Fernandez comes to the police and claims that the accused is his brother Josef Fernandez and not Annamalai. When he says this in the court, Annamalai refutes the claim saying he is a Hindu. He adds that it has become clear that it was Josef Fernandez who took wrong examples of role models and who has cheated the victims. The police perform a DNA test with the blood of Annamalai and David to see if they are really brothers and the test ends in failure. Annamalai states that his mother's name is Annapoorni and they were living at the village called Vataparai which the police verify. Rani  and her mother Chandra Bai appear as the next victims of fraud. Chandra Bai, who is a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna had done a public prayer for a revered saint, Harihara Das, to come to her ashram. A few days later, Harihara Das arrives at the ashram and states that Rani is the incarnation of Radha. They are also made to believe that Harihara Das is the incarnation of Lord Krishna, who has come to marry Rani, who is Radha's incarnation. Chandra Bai receives a phone call from Napoleon asking the Harihara Das to visit his place. Short of time, Rani and Harihara Das marry. Then Harihara Das fools everyone into thinking that he disappeared and went to heaven, while escaping with the jewels of the ashram. Annamalai says that this is just plain foolishness and fanaticism on the part of Chandra Bai and Rani and says the court cannot accept witnesses who are fools. He again states he is not the one who cheated them as Harihara Das. The last victim is identified as Monika  who is the managing director of Videocon. Unlike the other witnesses, she says she loved Annamalai who introduced himself to her with the name Shyam Prasad. Shyam had impressed her truly with his compassion, love and faithfulness. She asks the court to acquit him of all charges as she knows that Shyam is not such a person. Annamalai feels flattered by Monika's points but still states that he is not Shyam Prasad. During a police raid, Ammu Kutty's jewels were recovered. When the owner was questioned, he said someone called Napoleon sold them to him; the owner gives the police the phone number. Using this, they captures Napoleon. In the court, Napolean reveals his real name as Thambidurai . He says he was a friend of the accused but never knew what was going on. He said that he was given some dialogues to speak and some numbers to contact and he did what he was asked. He also said that the accused also asked him to deposit Rs.20 lakhs to Anbu old age home. The police investigate at the old age home and finds that Annamalai is not the real son of Annapoorni but adopted. They also learn that it was this place that the money of Rs.20 lakhs quoted by Napoleon was found. The police conclude that Annamalai is Josef Fernandez and, hence, the culprit. However, before the police could bring the proof against Annamalai, the judge, assuming all witnesses have appeared, prepares to give the judgment. The court starts its final day of hearing, assuming there were no other witnesses to produce. Annamalai says that he is innocent of all charges and the real culprit, who looks exactly like him, is free. He also accuses the victims of being greedy and consenting to an apparently advantageous marriage without proper thinking. The judge delivers the final judgment on the case saying that, based on the evidences submitted, it can only be suspected that Annamalai is the culprit. But there is no clear proof against him and, hence, she judge acquits him on the benefit of doubt before the police can arrive and prove him guilty. She also denounces the hasty decisions taken by the women and Rekha's brother who had offered bribe to a government official, which had brought them into such a situation. Outside the court, Annamalai is stabbed by another woman who claims to have been cheated by him. He asks forgiveness from Jesus and collapses, revealing he is Josef Fernandez. He is rescued by an ambulance. The last scene is Annamalai in a foreign country, enticing yet another woman into marrying him.\",\n",

Upon conviction, his family is fined with $45,000 and he is banned from owning or operating computers or touch-tone telephones until his 18th birthday. Shortly before Dade  turns 18, his mother  takes a job in New York City. Upon turning 18, Dade calls a local television station, dupes the security guard into giving him the modem\\'s phone number (a tactic known as [[Social engineering  and successfully hacks into the station\\'s computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of The Outer Limits. However, Dade is \"attacked\" by a hacker  on the same network. During the conversation, Dade identifies himself by the new alias, Crash Override, to hide his old alias as Zero Cool. Dade enrolls at Stanton High School, where he meets Kate Libby , who is assigned to take him on a tour of the school. After Dade learns that Kate is \"Acid Burn\", they feud over who is the better hacker. The real trouble begins when Joey Pardella , the novice hacker of the group, successfully breaks into an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer  to prove to the rest of the group that he is an elite hacker. To validate this feat, he downloads part of a garbage file. Unfortunately, the company\\'s IT employee Hal  detects this unauthorized entry and summons computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford  to deal with the problem. He realizes the file being downloaded can prove that The Plague is stealing from the company via salami slicing. The Plague enlists the U.S. Secret Service to recover the file by claiming that it is the code to Da Vinci, a computer virus that will capsize the company\\'s oil tanker fleet and he needs that code to destroy the virus. Joey is arrested and his computer is searched, but the Secret Service finds nothing, as Joey has hidden the disk containing the files. In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a hacking duel, with hacks focused on harassing Secret Service Agent Richard Gill , a known enemy of hackers, who was involved in Joey\\'s arrest. Kate and Dade\\'s hacker friends—Ramon Sanchez a.k.a. \"The Phantom Phreak,\" Emmanuel Goldstein a.k.a. \"Cereal Killer\", and Paul Cook a.k.a. \"Lord Nikon\" —act as judges.

That evening, Kate and Cereal Killer ask Dade for his help; but, because of his record, he declines. Kate then asks Dade to copy the disk so that, if anyone else is arrested, they have the disk as evidence.

Later, he threatens to have Dade\\'s mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate\\'s copy of the disk. Meanwhile, Kate, Lord Nikon, and Cereal Killer attempt to discern the contents of the disk. Dade joins them; and, after working all night, they learn the truth—it\\'s designed to salami-slice $25 million from Ellingson transactions. Dade reveals that he knows Plague is behind this scheme, because he was the one who wanted Kate\\'s copy of the disk. He admits he gave Plague the disk and reveals his history as Zero Cool. Determined to stop the scheme, the assembled hackers plan to hack the Gibson again. Kate and Dade go dumpster-diving for employee memos with passwords; Cereal Killer installs a hidden microphone in the Ellingson offices; and Nikon poses as a delivery boy wandering the Ellingson cubicles, memorizing employee passwords as they enter them. From the memos, they discover the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day, which would provide the perfect cover to distract from the salami-slicing worm. In need of help, they seek out Razor and Blade, the producers of a hacker-themed pirate TV show, \"Hack the Planet.\" The next morning, they evade the Secret Service and converge on Grand Central station, where they use payphones to begin their assault on the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to warn him to escape before he is arrested. However, Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support with virus attacks, distracting Plague long enough for Dade to download the incriminating file to a floppy disk. Shortly after crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. As they\\'re being led away, Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer, hiding in the crowd, that he\\'s tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam the local television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer, revealing the plot and Plague\\'s complicity. Plague is arrested when he tries to flee to Japan under the alias \"Mr. Babbage\" . Their names cleared, Dade and Kate go on a date. Kate even wears a dress. While relaxing in a pool on the roof of a building, their friends show off their latest hack—the lights in several adjacent office buildings spell out \"CRASH AND BURN.\"',\n",

              " 'The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by Father Merrin following the horrific events he witnessed during World War II. Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Lankester Merrin  travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest. Near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After WWII, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church from about circa 500 A.D. — long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Merrin is asked by the collector to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but is diverted by the Vatican to ensure that the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the dig, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during WWII and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\\'s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure. Merrin visits the dig site, although only the dome is uncovered, with the rest of the church buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after the construction was completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is convention for statues of angels not to have weapons or for them to be pointed triumphantly to heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside position, which is considered a desecration. Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Merrin is told by Sarah that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\\'s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact that Merrin was asked to find by the collector. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\\'s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them. Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed. Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there. Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple — but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession  and Joseph . At the end of the movie, the dig\\'s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church,  and history has repeated itself. 50  years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, \"But you found something....Didn\\'t you?\"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.',\n",

              " 'Captain Scott is given the men, but not the funds, to go on a second expedition to the Antarctic. As his wife works on a bust of him, she tells him that she\\'s \"not the least jealous\" that he\\'s going to the Antarctic again. The wife of a scientist whom Scott hopes to recruit has a very different opinion from Scott\\'s wife, but the scientist agrees to go. Scott also visits Fridtjof Nansen, who insists that a polar expedition must use dogs. Scott goes on a fundraising campaign, and despite popular scepticism, manages to raise enough money to fund the expedition. After a stop in New Zealand, the ship sets sail for Antarctica. Once there, a camp is set up at the coast, and a small contingent of men, horses and dogs begins the trek towards the pole. About halfway, the horses are shot and some of the men are sent back with the dogs. At the three quarter mark, Scott selects the five-man team to make the push to the pole. They reach the pole only to find the Norwegian flag already planted there and a letter from Roald Amundsen asking Scott to deliver it to the King of Norway. Hugely disappointed, Scott\\'s team begins the long journey back. Scott is very concerned about the health of two of his men: Evans, who has a serious cut on his hand, and Oates, whose foot is appallingly frostbitten. Evans eventually dies and is buried under the snow. Realizing that his condition is slowing the team down, Oates sacrificed himself by walking out of the tent into a blizzard to his death after saying \"I\\'m just going outside and I may be some time.\" Finally, just 11 miles short of a supply depot, the rest of the team dies in their tent after being trapped by a blizzard, with Scott writing the famous \"I do not regret this journey&hellip;\" entry in his diary. Months later, a search party discovered the tent and the bodies. Scott\\'s diary was also recovered, allowing the members to learn of the polar party\\'s fate. The film ends with the sight of a large wooden cross with the five names of the dead inscripted on it as well as the quote : \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\" The film was lampooned in the Monty Python Series 2 episode \\'Scott of the Antarctic\\'.Scott of the Antarctic',\n",

He loves spending time with his young son Max ([[Justin Cooper ; they often play a game where Fletcher makes his hand into \"the Claw\" and pretends to chase Max with it. But Fletcher has a habit of giving precedence to his job, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife Audrey , and then lying about the reasons. Fletcher\\'s compulsive lying has also built him a reputation as one of the best defense lawyers in the state of California as he is climbing the ladder in the firm for which he works. Ultimately, Fletcher misses his son\\'s fifth birthday party because he is having sex with his boss Miranda , in the hopes of making partner. Max makes a birthday wish that his father would be unable to tell a lie for an entire day &mdash; a wish that immediately becomes true. Fletcher soon discovers, through a series of embarrassing incidents &mdash; such as when he tells Miranda that he has \"had better\" sex than he just did with her &mdash; that he is unable to lie, mislead, or even withhold a true answer. These incidents are inconvenient, as he is fighting a divorce case in court which, should he win, could be a huge boost to his career. His client is the self-centered, money grabbing Samantha Cole . His main witness is willing to commit perjury to win, but Fletcher discovers that he cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer will be a lie; during the case he even objects to himself when he tries to lie to get the desired information. Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her new boyfriend Jerry , and decides that Max is going with them so that she can protect him from getting hurt by Fletcher. Fletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up, but he cannot conceal that he is able to continue, so the judge  insists that he does. Finally he realizes that his client had lied about her age and therefore had signed her prenuptial agreement while a minor, rendering it invalid. This allows him to win his case truthfully, but the repercussions become a catalyst to his understanding of what he himself is about to lose. Samantha who only cared about her ex-husband\\'s money, takes custody of her children purely so her ex-husband would be forced to continue paying her for child care and literally pulls the children out of the arms of their responsible and caring father. Fletcher then has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge to reverse the decision, and is taken to jail for contempt of court. Audrey refuses to pay his bail, which is eventually paid by his secretary Greta , who forgives him for his earlier rude truth-tellings after hearing he \"went all noble\" in front of their firm\\'s senior partner. Now recognizing his son Max as his highest priority, Fletcher struggles to keep him. He hurries to the airport, but Audrey and Max\\'s plane has already left the terminal. Desperate, he hijacks a mobile stairway and pursues the plane onto the runway. The plane finally stops, but Fletcher is injured. On his way to the hospital, he vows to his son to spend more time with him and never hurt him again. Even though the 24 hours of truth are up, Max knows he means it, and Audrey decides not to move to Boston with Jerry after all. One year later, Fletcher and Audrey are celebrating Max\\'s birthday. The lights go off when Max blows out his birthday candles. When they go back on, Fletcher and Audrey are kissing. Fletcher asks Max if he wished for his mom and his dad to get back together and Max replies \"No, I wished for roller blades!\" The family seemingly returns to normal as Fletcher chases Audrey and Max around the house with \"the Claw\".',\n",

              " 'The film is set during the transition period between the Sui Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. It opens with various shots of the Shaolin Temple, including the wall paintings, the many beautiful trees, gardens, shrines, gates, and statues of Buddha and the Gods. The temple bells toll as the monks kneel in the pillared inner sanctum and bow before the great altar of the Golden Buddha, before which sits the Abbot of Shaolin. A shaven-headed, blue-robed novice  stands with his palms pressed together and his head bowed. He is about to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot speaks to him of ceremony, purification, and learning to respect one\\'s self and others. Then the Abbot asks for his name. \"Jue Yuan\", he answers. The Abbot tells him that to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple, he must vow to not commit murder. He asks if he can obey this, but Jue Yuan is silent, staring downward. The Abbot repeats the question, and Jue Yuan slowly raises his eyes, gazing intensely at him. The Abbot asks the question a third time... The film flashes back to the warlord and deadly fighter Wang Shichong killing an old man with a throat lock and throwing him off a high brick wall into a muddy river, then abusively ordering the rest of his slaves back to work. They\\'re at a labor camp by the great river, toiling in the mud among corpses that hang from gallows as the soldiers whip them. It is during the rebellions at the end of the Sui Dynasty, when China became divided between various factions. Wang Shichong, who ruled from Luoyang, has treacherously installed himself as Emperor of the East Capitol, and is overseeing the bolstering of his riverfront defenses against the rival warlords on the opposite bank. They are near the Shaolin Temple. He forces even the old, crippled, and sick to work, but still the work isn\\'t progressing fast enough for him. He orders an officer to bring all his prisoners, who are opposing rebels, to join the slaves. These rebels include an older kung fu master, famous for his kicking skill, and his long-haired son, Jue Yuan. The soldiers whip the slaves, and one old slave collapses and drops a wooden beam, which causes an officer\\'s horse to rear and throw the officer. The officer begins to beat the slave to death, but Jue Yuan\\'s father attacks him, though his ankles and wrists are chained together. The officer proves to be a kung fu fighter, and they fight, but Jue Yuan\\'s father still manages to defeat him. This draws the attention of the Emperor, who attacks Jue Yuan\\'s father himself and rips his throat out with his bare hand. Jue Yuan rushes in and unleashes the kicking skills that his father taught him, scattering the guards and fighting the officers, but then the Emperor beats him up and deals him a deadly Dim Mak palm strike to the chest. Jue Yuan is thrown into the river, and he manages to swim away and escape. He staggers through the wild, dying of his wounds, but finally he manages to reach the Shaolin Temple. The Sifu  is teaching the monks staff kung fu when Jue Yuan arrives and falls unconscious. Throngs of refugees from the war-torn countryside are flocking to the Shaolin Temple every day. The Abbot proclaims that it is their holy duty as Buddhist monks to pray for the refugees and do all they can to help them. They nurse Jue Yuan back to health. When he has recovered, he joins them in carrying water from the river to the Temple, which they use as kung fu conditioning. He struggles, but is helped by a beautiful girl named Bai Wu Xia , who sings and herds rams in the beautiful wildlife-filled forested hills that surround the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan spies on the monks\\' kung fu training and gets himself into various other comedic misadventures around the Shaolin Temple, befriending the light-hearted, fun-loving, mischievous Sifu and his equally mischievous kung fu students in the process. One night they all sneak out to eat and party around a fire in the woods. There he learns more about the Sifu and his former family in the North. He learns that the Sifu is Bai Wu Xia\\'s father, that she was one of the main ones who nursed him back to health, and that she is skilled at kung fu. The Sifu says that nine years ago, he and his wife were being chased by the Emperor and his soldiers, and he left his wife with a farmer to hide while he fled on, eventually hiding in the Shaolin Temple. The farmer, who had no children, raped the woman, and it is implied that he also murdered her. Bai Wu Xia\\'s whereabouts during these events are not made clear. Jue Yuan declares that he will kill the Emperor, and he asks the Sifu to train him in his Northern Shaolin kung fu. The Sifu tells him that Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not killing, and besides, Jue Yuan isn\\'t a monk. Jue Yuan drops to his knees, presses his palms together, and says that he wants to become a monk. Jue Yuan’s head is shaven, and he bows before the Abbot of Shaolin on the great altar of the golden Buddha. The assembled monks sing mystic hymns, ring bells, and strike gongs. A mosquito bites Jue Yuan as he kneels there, and he kills it, but the Abbot blesses and accepts him, and he is ordained as a junior monk. Jue Yuan joins his fellow monks in Northern Shaolin kung fu training. After a time of at least several months he has gained impressive fighting abilities, but while sparring, his enemy flashes with the visage of the Emperor in his mind, and he almost kills his partner. He is banned from practicing kung fu. His emotions flare quickly out of control, and he runs away from the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan attempts to assassinate the Emperor, but fails and is forced to flee. Ashamed, he returns to the Shaolin Temple. His Sifu admonishes him, but welcomes him home and allows him to resume his Northern Shaolin kung fu training. Jue Yuan trains for at least another year, as seen in a ‘four seasons’ training sequence, and becomes highly adept at Northern Shaolin kung fu. Then another refugee comes fleeing to Shaolin, this one pursued by the Emperor and his men. This refugee is Li Shimin, son of a great leader who founded the Tang Dynasty, Li Yuan. The Shaolin monks keep peace with the Emperor and his men, and make a show of helping them hunt for Li Shimin. But Jue Yuan helps Li Shimin escape through the mountains, and Jue Yuan and Li Shimin end up hiding together in an abandoned ancient mountainous cave temple with many giant statues of Buddha and the Gods. Bai Wu Xia stealthily brings them food and water. Li Shimin must escape, though, so Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia help him, sneaking and bribing their way past the Emperor’s patrols in disguise. Throughout this time, a forbidden romance builds between Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia. But they fail in their clean escape, and Li Shimin and Bai Wu Xia flee on a raft down a river, Li Shimin with an arrow in his leg, while Jue Yuan sacrifices himself to slow down the Emperor’s outriders. However, his Sifu from Shaolin and a group of Shaolin warrior monks come to his aid and massacre the outriders. They save Jue Yuan’s life, but his Sifu excommunicates him from Shaolin for his acts and banishes him. He desperately follows them back to the Shaolin Temple anyway, but they throw him out and drive him away. The Emperor learns what the Shaolin monks did, and marches on the Shaolin Temple with his army to destroy it. Jue Yuan comes back yet again, and this time his Sifu sends him away along with Ba Wu Xia, to take her to safety and never return. The Abbot of Shaolin orders the monks not to fight, even while the Emperor’s army surrounds the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot treats with the Emperor. He appeals that the Temple has a very long history, and a crime should not merit the destruction of the buildings, or any of the monks. As the Abbot, he accepts the blame. The Emperor has him placed on a great pyre, which is set aflame. He tells the monks that if they reveal the traitors’ whereabouts, he’ll spare the Temple and the Abbot’s life. When no one talks, he has his men kill several of the other top monks, and threatens that if no one talks, they’ll all be killed. Then the Sifu and the warrior monks reveal themselves. The Sifu cries that they must fight. The Abbot, as he is immersed in fire, tells the Sifu to release the souls of the Emperor and his men and send them to Heaven. And so the battle is joined. Many monks are killed. Jue Yuan and Ba Wu Xia return to the embattled Shaolin Temple. The Emperor’s army takes the outer walls and outer grounds, and kills all the monks therein. The surviving monks fall back within the inner walls. The Sifu is shot full of arrows. He entreats Jue Yuan to protect Shaolin and uphold justice, and dies. The Emperor and his men break open the inner gate with a battering ram, and they’re about to massacre the rest of the monks, but then the Emperor receives word that Li Shimin and his army are approaching his own East Capital, and they abandon the siege of the Shaolin Temple and ride for the East Capital with all speed. Jue Yuan and the warrior monks ride after the Emperor and his men and join the battle at the ravaged East Capital, at the very site where the Emperor killed Jue Yuan’s father. Jue Yuan and the Emperor duel with swords and empty hands and feet on the shores of the great river. Their battle climbs up a great wooden structure, falls off the top into the river, and returns to the shore. Finally Jue Yuan uses his Northern Shaolin kung fu to kill the Emperor, and the battle for the East Capital is won. The film returns to its beginning, with Jue Yuan in the sanctum of the Shaolin Temple, kneeling before the high altar, as the new Abbot asks him if he can obey the vow to do no murder. Jue Yuan vows that he shall not kill save to uphold righteousness, and the Abbot accepts this. Jue Yuan continues to swear his vows, but when he reaches the vow of celibacy, he is again conflicted. He opens his folded palms to look at a jade amulet. He flashes back again. He and Bai Wu Xia kneel and bow before the shrine of the fallen previous Abbot, to whom they have offered many baskets of fruit and other foods. Jue Yuan speaks aloud to the Abbot of how he is determined to enter Buddha. Bai Wu Xia gazes at him with tears in her eyes, knowing what this means. Jue Yuan vows to defend Shaolin and uphold justice, quoting the last words of his fallen Sifu, Bai Wu Xia’s father. Bai Wu Xia gives him the jade amulet, a token of her love, and departs. Now, in the present, he looks up from the jade amulet to see Bai Wu Xia, who has snuck into the side wing of the sanctum and is staring at him from behind a great pillar. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves. The great bell of Shaolin tolls, and the gongs and drums are beaten as Jue Yuan is ordained as a true monk of Shaolin. The film’s closing scene is of Jue Yuan, now the new kung fu Sifu of the Shaolin Temple, leading the monks in their training.',\n",

              " \"The film begins during the late 1960s  at the House of Lords, with Lord Longford, a regular prison visitor, presiding over a reception for a number of ex-convicts whom he had visited and corresponded with when they were incarcerated. He receives a letter from one of the most notorious criminals in Britain, the so-called Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, who is several years into her life sentence for taking part in the murder of three children with her boyfriend, Ian Brady. When he visits her, she asks for books but also for him to arrange for her to meet Brady. Longford is shocked and tells her that it would be in her own best interests to have no contact with Brady, as it might harm any future chances of parole. Hindley seems equally shocked at the idea that she would ever be allowed parole. Longford then begins his campaign for Hindley to be paroled. The question remains of whether Hindley is indeed reformed &mdash; for example, in her decision to convert to Longford's own Roman Catholic faith &mdash; or whether she is merely manipulating him and feigning her rehabilitation in an attempt to bring herself closer to release. Longford visits Brady twice; on both occasions, Brady tells him that she is manipulative and that he should turn his back on her. Longford, driven by his deep religious belief that all people are ultimately good, decides to continue on his course, despite heavy public, political, and family criticism and even though it turns out that Hindley has not been honest with him. In 1986 she reveals that she and Brady were responsible for two further murders. Even as Hindley's revelations sparked yet more public hostility towards Longford for trying to win her release, he remains loyal to Hindley and continues to back her campaign for release. He is last seen visiting her in prison in the late 1990s, by which time Longford is frail and more than 90 years old, while Hindley is still in her 50s but in a declining state of health. As the film ends and just before the credits start to roll, we are informed that Longford died in August 2001, while Hindley never got the parole that she spent a generation fighting for and remained imprisoned until her death in November 2002.\",\n",

              " 'Episode 1: A New Life FormVajra>Vajra is a Sanskrit word meaning both thunderbolt and diamond. In Buddhism, the Vajra is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major branches of Buddhism, and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or bodhi as well as indestructibility . In addition to having almost unlimited strength and regenerative abilities, Genocyber also possess incredible telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers. After a brutal search by the scientist and his masked henchmen for Elaine that leaves dozens of corpses in its wake, Elaine is apparently captured by agents of a shadowy government organisation and the scientist is arrested. However, Elaine then uses her psychic power to merge with Diana and become Genocyber. In the ensuing battle, in which the scientist and government agents are killed, huge fires are started and numerous buildings are heavily damaged. The next morning, Elaine finds that her only friend, a young homeless boy she met before she was captured, has died after falling from a construction site. Elaine becomes filled with anger and screams, turning into Genocyber, and initiating a massive explosion which completely destroys Hong Kong, leaving only a barren wasteland in its place.  The second OVA apparently occurs shortly after this first one ended. A country called Karain The fictional country of Karain depicted in the OVAs appears to have no relation to the fictional continent of the same name in Austin Tappan Wright\\'s novel Islandia, or to Karain Cave, which is an Paleolithic archaeological site located in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.However, a map shown of Karain, combined with a statements that the country is surrounded by deserts on three sides  suggests that it is intended to be an analogy to the real-life country of Kuwait, which at the time, had been invaded by Iraq and was subject to an American-led UN offensive to against the Iraqi occupation forces in early 1991. has withdrawn from the United Nations in protest of the new World government and launched an invasion of a neighboring country. In response, the United States agrees to deploy a Carrier Strike Group to support offensive operations against Karain; this fleet will be led by the Alexandria, a massive futuristic Supercarrier, which is currently stationed off the coast of Japan. However, satellite photographs have identified an unknown superweapon believed to have been deployed by Karain . Concerned about the power of this new weapon, the United States military requests assistance from the Kuryu Group. Realizing that the image is in fact of Genocyber , the Kuryu Group agrees to send a team of its top scientists to the Alexandria. The Kuryu scientists, including the mentally unstable Sakomizu, bring on board their own secret weapon, a newly-created Vajra, out of anticipation that the fleet will encounter Genocyber. Unlike Genocyber, this new Vajra has a completely robotic body that enables it to almost literally fuse with any machine or weapon it operates. This is demonstrated when the Vajra fuses with a fighter aircraft, enhancing the fighter\\'s capabilities far beyond anything that would be possible for a human pilot. As the fleet travels from Japan to Karain, the Vajra is conducting a test flight in a fighter when a UN scout plane operating near Karain radios in and requests to make an emergency landing. The pilot also has aboard a civilian he rescued near Karain: Elaine. As the scout plane approaches the carrier, Elaine senses the Vajra, which in turn senses Elaine. Alarmed, the Vajras fighter veers wildly off-course in pursuit of the scout plane, entering into a steep dive and nearly crashing into the carrier. The scout plane is forced to make a crash landing on carrier deck, although Elaine survives unscathed. The carrier\\'s senior officers sharply rebuke Sakomizu for the Vajras strange behavior, yelling at him that his Vajra is not only dangerous, but is also uncontrollable.In the original Japanese version, the American officers rebuking Sakomizu refer to him using the racist term \"you goddamn Jap!\". In the English dub, this was changed to \"you stupid ignorant f#%@ing piece of s%#!.\" Later, Sakomizu yells at the Vajra for embarrassing him. Unlike in the previous OVA, Elaine now has a largely cybernetic body from the neck down. Although it is unclear why and how this change occurred, it is possible that Elaine and Diana  have merged. A young female doctor, Myra, takes Elaine under her protection and gives her the name Laura. To Myra, Laura/Elaine reminds her of her own daughter  who died in a plane crash several years earlier. Although Elaine is still mute, she is able to communicate telepathically with Myra, with whom she forms a special bond. Almost immediately, Myra comes to think of Laura/Elaine as her own child. Neither Myra nor the crew are aware of the girl\\'s psychic abilities and her presence on board is briefly uneventful. However, numerous members of the crew begin having nightmarish visions and several suffer mental breakdowns. Soon after, the Vajra again senses Elaine, and interprets her presence  as a threat to itself and the ship. Elaine also senses the new Vajra, and after seeking it out, transforms into Genocyber and destroys it, but Genocyber\\'s arm is hacked off during the fight. The ship\\'s crew, unaware of what actually happened, simply conclude that Sakomizu\\'s Vajra has malfunctioned again, and blame him for the incident in which several crewmembers are killed . However, Sakomizu, upon seeing his Vajra destroyed, is insulted and wrongly concludes that the crew sabotaged his work, although he now clearly suspects that Elaine is more she appears to be. He eventually creates a new Vajra after acquiring Genocyber\\'s severed arm but is unable to control it; the Vajra then expands throughout the carrier, engulfing and consuming the entire crew, except for Myra, whom Genocyber saves. Sakomizu also appears to survive initially, before he too is consumed by the Vajra. Genocyber then flies into the carrier and reaches the core of the Vajra. The Vajra attempts to fuse itself with Genocyber but Genocyber\\'s psychic powers prove to be stronger and the Vajra loses control of its body and the consumed carrier, which detonates in a massive explosion. Later, Myra is rescued by two Karain helicopter pilots as they investigate the remains of the American fleet. Deciding that Myra is delirious, they fly back to Karain, but are horrifed to discover that the entire country has been devastated and that the capital city is in flames. Genocyber then rises above the country and spreads its wings, confirming that Karain has suffered a similar fate as Hong Kong. The episode ends with Genocyber flying away, as Myra, who has been driven to near-madness by the events, yells \"It\\'s my daughter, Laura! She\\'s become an angel! Take me Laura! Take me away from this hell!\"  The third OVA is much different from its previous ones, taking place in a post-apocalyptic earth, in a region called the City of the Grand Ark. The young girl, Elaine , does not appear much in this episode, only a transparent image in the story. In this story, Genocyber eventually realizes that \"there was no place in the world for its power\" and is dormant until it reawakens at the end. In a brief opening scene, the now-extremly elderly leader of the Kuryu Group is seen looking at a wall of computer screens that show Genocyber on a rampage of destruction. It is revealed that for 100 years, humanity has been waging a desperate and hopeless war against Genocyber, which has decimated the Earth. The leader of the Kuryu Group vows to find someway to stop Genocyber, even if it takes centuries. However, Genocyber then attacks his location, and a massive explosion is seen to rise into the Earth\\'s atmosphere. The next scene, apparently set further into the future, shows a massive spacestation, possibly a colony ship, orbiting Earth. A computer monitor on board indicates that it is now the year 2400 AD. The story starts out in Ark de Grande City , one of the last remaining cities on earth, which is controlled by an evil mayor who claims that he is restoring the civilization that was destroyed by Genocyber, but only does this to gain trust from the civilians. The Mayor is ruthless, killing anyone who opposes him, and most of the city\\'s population a lives only as a labour class with few rights, while the mayor and an upper class live in luxury. The story shifts to a couple, Ryu and Mel, whom Ryu is trying to find a doctor good enough to cure Mel\\'s blindness. They arrive in Ark de Grande City but, as members of the lower class, are unable to get the medical help necessary to allow Mel to see again. Ryu and Mel attempt to earn money as performers, as Mel possesses an extraordinary ability to determine appearances, colours and numbers, even though she is blind. She describes her power as an ability to \"see the person\\'s form floating in my mind.\" She also has remarkable hearing and can often sense the environment around her. Ryu has an ability to throw knives while blindfolded, and hit targets with pinpoint accuracy. After Ryu and Mel make love that night, Ryu says that he hopes to earn enough money so that they can leave the city as soon as possible. Later, Ryu is recruited by a member of the upper class to perform at his establishment, promising a large sum of money. However, the man tricks Ryu  into throwing knives at a real person who is tied to a wall, killing him, much to the delight of the spectators. Realizing that he has been tricked, Ryu manages to escape but is now pursued by the city\\'s guards. While Ryu and Mel try to hide in the ruins beneth the city, Mel hears Elaine\\'s voice calling to her, and she and Mel find themselves in a ritual chamber with a seemingly fossilized head and torso of Genocyber at the centre of an altar. A flashback then shows Genocyber on its rampage of destruction. An image of Diana appears, and her voice then calls to Elaine, telling her that \"It has to end. We can\\'t stay in this world. We can\\'t use our power\" The two sisters then join hands and disappear, while Genocyber is seen lying on the ground, having seemingly been turned to stone. The scene shifts back to the present and to a shot of the massive spacestation orbiting the earth.  In a series of images, Mel is seen walking with Diana towards Genocyber\\'s broken body. An image of Elaine appears in front of Genocyber, and Diana screams. In a subsequent dream, Diana refers to Mel as \"big sister.\" The scene shifts back to Mel, who is taken in by the religious sect which opposes the Mayor. The sect believes that the destruction brought by Genocyber was a punishment from God, and believe that Mel is God\\'s messenger, who will prevent such destruction from happening again. Meanwhile, Ryu makes his way up to the surface, where he is detained and subject to brutal interrogation by the police, after which he is apparently declared brain-dead. As Mel worries about Ryu, it is revealed that she is pregnant with his child. Under orders to destroy anyone opposing the mayor, the city\\'s troops then attack the sect\\'s church, killing everyone, including  Mel, whose bullet-riddled body lies on the ground with the bodies of children surrounding her. In an apparent dream, Diana begs Elaine not to turn into Genocyber again, stating that \"Our power has no place in this world.\" Mel, who appears to be in some sort of cocoon, asks Diana for help, stating that if she dies, the child she is carrying will never be born. She also states that she wants the city destroyed. Diana warns that asking for such power will unleash Genocyber, but it is too late: Genocyber awakens as Elaine, Diana, and Mel amalgamate into a red version of Genocyber, one which is much larger than its previous form. As Genocyber emerges, monitors aboard the orbiting space station switch on and begin recording the event. Genocyber then attacks the city, killing the mayor, and then all of its citizens. Soldiers attempt to stop Genocyber, but their weapons prove useless, and they too are killed. By the time Genocyber\\'s rampage is over, the entire city has been left in ruins. As Genocyber rises into the sky, whole pieces of the city\\'s remains begin to tear away from the ground and rise into the air. Genocyber resurrects Mel and Ryu, and Mel is then torn from Genocyber; she and Ryu begin to slowly fall into the burning city. Genocyber then reverts to its earlier smaller form, and images of Elaine and Diana are seen superimposed against Genocyber as it ascends into the sky. Genocyber then flies into space and attacks the orbiting space station, whose defenses open fire on Genocyber, but with no effect. Genocyber breaks into the station and watches a repeating broadcast of Genichiro Kuryu, the former leader of the Kuryu group, ordering its forces to destroy Genocyber. Diana\\'s voice then calls to Elaine, and images of the girls superimposed against Genocyber are briefly seen before Genocyber begins to freeze itself and the entire space station. The station then falls out of orbit, and explodes as it enters the atmosphere. The last scene shows Mel, who is no longer blind, and Ryu, lying unconscious in the ruins of the city. As Mel opens her eyes, she hears Diana\\'s voice calling, \"Big sister...\", and the scene turns to the ruined body of Genocyber, and a baby is heard crying in the background. The screen the goes black, and several black and white images of Elaine and Diana as small children are seen as the closing credits begin. The ending of the OVA is vague; It is not known what happens to Ryu and Mel afterward, if there are any other survivors on Earth, if Genocyber is still alive, or if Elaine can still manifest herself as the girl seen in the first two OVAs.  Elaine: A young mute girl who seems to be innocent in appearance, but when merged with her less powerful counterpart, she becomes Genocyber, capable of mass destruction as seen in all three OVAs. Her friend was a young boy who devoted his self to protect her, but was unable to when the government agents killed him. This causes Elaine to completely wipe out Hong Kong. In the second OVA, Elaine is named \"Laura\" by a young doctor, Myra, who once had a daughter about that age but died in a plane accident  . Elaine is also proved to be superior to any Vajura in combat, including the one on the American carrier. Most of Genocyber\\'s attacks include fire and flames that are used as weapons. In the third OVA, Elaine appears much as in a dormant state, confined to her dream-like world with her older sister, Diana. It is not fully explained in the beginning, but is later revealed that both Elaine and Diana realized that their \"power wasn\\'t meant to be for this world\" and they decided to go into a state of \"seclusion\", only to be reawakened when Genocyber decides to destroy the City of the Grand Ark, killing everyone except for Mel and Ryu. Genocyber then flies into space and destroys an orbiting space station with Kyuru\\'s former leader on a screen, talking about the destruction of Genocyber. It is not known what happens to Genocyber afterward. It is implied through subsequent imagery that Elaine and Diana\\'s consciousnesses still exist within Genocyber, although it is unknown if Genocyber is still alive or if Elaine  can ever remanifest herself as the girl seen in the first two OVAs. In the Japanese version, both Elaine and Diana are voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu. Diana: Elaine\\'s older sister. She seems to have great power as well, but is almost nothing compared to her younger sister, as shown in part one of the OVA. Diana is quite jealous of her sister\\'s skills and abilities, which causes her to try to kill her sister several times, yet proves to be futile. She merges with Elaine in the first OVA after being dismembered, with Elaine consciously controlling the body, and does not appear again until the third OVA. Diana appears physically older than her twin sister, because her body is almost completely cybernetic, due to the fact she was born without use of her arms or legs. Genocyber: The complete hybrid of the two sisters, Genocyber is the ultimate biological humanoid weapon  who is seemingly immortal and is nearly omnipotent. It is considered a god by the underground sect. It fought with the Earth\\'s forces for 100 years, but after the two sisters realized their mistake in existing in the world, they lay dormant underground. Its original appearance is a {{convert}} green creature with two horns protruding from its head. It also has angel-like wings that appear to glow when it flies. Its second form is much larger, taller than a skyscraper, causing mass destruction within the City of the Grand Ark. Its full form is a dragon-like creature. Exactly how Genocyber was created from the bodies and souls of the two sisters remains a mystery. Although the two sisters possess strong psychic abilities, the story vaguely depicts Morgan Nguyen in the beginning trying to create a mandala to fortify his embryonic child. In addition to possessing incredible strength and resilience, Genocyber displays extremely powerful telekinetic and pyrokinetic abilities. Given its appearance and nature, Genocyber is most likely intended to be an man-made analogy to the Angel Of Death; and possibly a warning of the terrible consequences that can occur when humans attempt to use Synthetic biology to create weapons that are beyond their control. Kenneth Reed: Claiming to be Elaine\\'s and Diana\\'s father, he both supports them to become a hybrid strong enough to prove the power of Vajura. He is near succession when Elaine suddenly escapes. He eventually dies after being taken custody of the two government agents, smiling as he watches his creation bloom out in the world. Myra: A female doctor who only appears in the second OVA, who takes care of Elaine after she is rescued by a civilian plane. Myra is very protective of Elaine, especially when people push her around for her unusual animal-like behavior. Myra, eventually, survives the carrier\\'s explosion and is rescued by two Karain soldiers though her sanity is unwell and truly lost by that time. Mel: A beautiful and mysterious young woman who is blind and needs money for the operation to cure her, and obtains money by fortune telling with her amazing psychic abilities. She is very calm and timid, and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Ryu. When she takes refuge in the underground sect, they believe her to be the Messiah. She is depressed at the moment because of Ryu\\'s disappearance and her pregnant state. She eventually dies at one point in the third OVA, along with the entire underground sect, but then is brought back to life by Genocyber when she and the two sisters fuse together as she states in the hyperdimensional mandala scene, \"I want this city destroyed.\" She is cured of her blindness at the end. There seems to be some connection between her and Diana, since they constantly communicate in Mel\\'s dreams, whom Diana also calls, \"Big sister.\" Ryu: A handsome young man who is Mel\\'s boyfriend. He aids with helping Mel cure her blindness, but does not have enough money to do so. One day, he is to throw knives at a target to gain money. He accidentally kills a man and is pursued by the city\\'s government. He is eventually caught and put into custody. He is later shown unconscious at the end of the third OVA with Mel, who wakes up to find her dearest asleep. Genichiro Kuryu: The chairman of Kuryu, he was first introduced in the series as a young boy controlling a giant company. In the second OVA, he sends an attack on the country Karain by making the overall decision. In the third OVA, Genichiro has become an old man, fighting for over 100 years with Genocyber, which was all to no avail. He himself states, \"Who created you to give you so much power?\" He later appears in a screen in an outer-space object, repeating a phrase, \"destroy the target \" over and over again. The mysterious object was frozen by Genocyber itself and perhaps destroyed. Dr. Nguyen Morgan: Elaine and Diana\\'s true father. He was the first to come up with an idea to create a Vajranoid whose power was limitless, and tries to achieve this by testing his wife Tanya by creating a mandala to carry out his work. He was assisted by Kenneth Reed, who later wanted the credit of producing such a weapon, and eventually kills Morgan. The time and place of the birth of Elaine and Diana are unknown, but they were born after the explosion of the research center, with a surviving Tanya. Nguyen Morgan appears only in the flashbacks of the first and second OVA\\'s. Sakomizu: A scientist who wishes to surpass Morgan\\'s research and does this by also creating a vajranoid weapon.  He succeeds in creating a powerful Vajura, but is proved to be matchless when in combat with Genocyber. He eventually creates a second Vajura that was made from Genocyber\\'s severed arm when it was fighting his first vajura. Sakomizu becomes insane, as he turns the entire crew of the carrier Alexandria into part of the vajura. Sakomizu is also by this time controlled by the Vajura, only to be first attacked by Myra, and then killed by Elaine. He, like all scientists who studied in creating an ideal Vajura, died ironically in the end. Other characters: Government Agents 1, 2, & 3: These agents, 2 male, and one female, are sent by Headquarters in Tokyo to retrieve Elaine and Diana. These three agents are cyborgs who have no mercy, killing people on a subway train to keep their actions to capture Elaine secret. One is killed by Elaine\\'s power after they capture her, and the other 2 go insane during Genocyber\\'s rampage in Hong Kong, transforming into monstrous mechanical forms, multilating corpses, before fighting Genocyber and being destroyed Captain: Captain of the Alexandria. He is also eventually fused with the ship\\'s vajura, and dies in the end with the entire crew when Genocyber emits its great power. Grimson Rockwell: An evil mayor of the Ark de Grande who is a hypocrite, and kills anyone who opposes the law. He dies near the end when Genocyber throws his parade car into a building.',\n",

              " \"The sun of the Green Lantern homeworld, Oa, is becoming a gateway for Krona, an evil anti-matter alien tyrant that once sought to destroy all life. As precaution the Guardians of the Universe decide to evacuate Oa of all valuables, such as the Central Battery. While in line to charge their rings before the Battery is taken away, Green Lantern Corps rookie Arisia Rrab converses with Hal Jordan and expresses her selfdoubts as the newest Green Lantern. In response, Hal tells her the story of the first Green Lantern:  Avra, a scribe to the Guardians, is chosen by one of the first four power rings despite having no skill as a warrior. Avra and the other three original Green Lanterns are sent to stop a nation of warring aliens. One of the four Lanterns is killed and, with defeat at hand, Avra uses his willpower and imagination as a writer to continue the battle. He creates the first construct from his ring, a sword, that is used to decimate the alien war crafts. Taking Avra’s lead the other two Lanterns also create shapes from their power rings to win the fight. Thanks to Avra the war is won and the power to shape constructs from the power rings is discovered. Avra rises in prestige among the growing Green Lantern Corps, and after his death his ring is passed down until it eventually becomes Abin Sur's and then Hal Jordan's. Back in line at the Central Battery, Hal and Arisia meet Kilowog, the head trainer of the Green Lantern Corps. He antagonizes Arisia as a rookie and reminds her that she still has boot camp. Hal tells Arisia not to fear Kilowog and relates the story of Kilowog's own trainer.  Sgt. Deegan trains a rookie Kilowog and others by removing their power rings and putting them in deadly settings. Kilowog confronts Deegan and accuses him of a reckless training method and having no value for the lives of his trainees. Sgt. Deegan is then called to act with his recruits when a nearby planet comes under attack. Deegan purposefully drops Kilowog’s ring before departing with the other recruits. In the battle Sgt. Deegan orders the rookies to protect the refugees as he deals with the invaders. As Kilowog catches up, Sgt. Deegan is mortally wounded. Kilowog destroys the army and goes to Deegan's side. Deegan tells Kilowog he never would have let his rookies die and that he did what was best for their training. He passes superiority to Kilowog who then takes up completing the mission. Hal and Arisia arrive at a border patrol of the sun and await Krona's return. Arisia meets a Lantern named Laira and Hal shares her story:  Once a princess, Laira is sent on her first solo mission to her homeworld to deal with charges that her people are attacking other nations unprovoked. Standing in her way, Laira quickly defeats her father's mistress and her belittling brother. But when she faces her father she is saddened to learn that the recent war crimes were his own decision. He has been driven into rage by the loss of honor that Laira's ring chose her and not him. Laira is ultimately able to defeat her father who admits she has truly earned her adulthood. He then commits ritual suicide to maintain his honor. Back at the border patrol of Oa's sun, every Lantern has been called to await Krona's return. The only absent Lantern noted is Mogo. Hal explains who Mogo is and why he is not present:  Bolphunga the Unrelenting seeks to fight and destroy all the most powerful warriors in the universe and is told he will never defeat the Green Lantern Mogo. Bolphunga’s computer contains no stats on Mogo except his whereabouts on a mysterious green planet. There Bolphunga spends weeks tracking Mogo's power signatures but never finds the elusive Lantern. Bolphunga sets explosives all over the planet to flush Mogo out but is horrified when the planet extinguishes all the bombs and Mogo is revealed to be the entire planet. At Oa's sun Hal and Arisia are attacked by Krona's Shadow Demons and rescued by Sinestro. Sinestro then speaks of the prophecy that Oa will be destroyed and relates a story of Abin Sur and the Lantern view on destiny:  Hal Jordan's predecessor Abin Sur fights Atrocitus, an alien criminal speaking dark prophecies. Abin Sur is assisted by Sinestro in capturing the alien. Sinestro and Abin Sur then have a conversation relating to the warnings that Atrocitus spoke and Sinestro insists that he does not believe in destiny. Parting ways, Abin Sur takes the criminal to a prison planet where Atrocitus again speaks on Abin Sur's imminent death. He also warns Abin that Sinestro will rise against the Green Lantern Corps and create his own lantern corps built on the power of fear. Abin Sur however refuses to believe his friend would betray his Green Lantern duties.  Krona finally arrives from the Oa Sun. All the Green Lanterns fight swarms of Shadow Demons as Krona, an enormous figure, rises from the sun. Many Green Lanterns are killed and all others fall back. It is Arisia who devises a plan: if Krona is made of anti-matter then an equal or greater amount of matter will destroy him on contact. The Green Lanterns fall behind the planet Oa and push it at Krona. Krona uses Shadow Demons to push back and the Corps finds itself stymied while taking casualties. However, Mogo the Living Planet arrives and uses its own mass and Lantern Power to assist his comrades. Oa and Krona are forced into the sun and both are annihilated. The prophecy of Oa's destruction is fulfilled, but Krona is destroyed and the Corps is saved. Mogo volunteers to be the Corps' temporary base as they build a new Oa. Arisia is honored with an official entry into the Book of Oa for her heroic ingenuity, although she still has to report for Kilowog's training.\",\n",

              " 'Scouting out a new home, Hubie calls over Bertie, who begins to gaze into it before Hubie slaps Bertie to make him realize that before they can move in, the cat Claude, who has an award for Best Mouser - 1948 along with other mouser awards), must be removed first. Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks. First, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happens, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude Cat. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting. Claude then takes the bottle of catnip he had hidden in an overhead lamp and tosses it out the window then he mutters. With the logs removed from the fireplace, Hubie lowers Bertie and a dog  in a doghouse down the chimney. While the dog is sleeping, Bertie pulls out the dog\\'s lower lip such that it snaps back on him, but not before Bertie is pulled back up the chimney. Seeing only Claude, the dog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney. Completely nerve-wracked as a result of the beating, Claude then runs to the bathroom to take a dose of nerve tonic. While Claude is in the bathroom, Bertie then inserts a lit firecracker into Claude\\'s pillow, which blows up not after he returns to it. Claude then nervously gulps down the remainder of the nerve tonic. Next, Bertie returns down the chimney and runs a piece of string throughout the house, out of it into a water catch drain, down a ladder, and then back into the house, with the other end of the string attached to a rock on top of the chimney. Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude\\'s tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy. Claude then reads \"Psychology of Dreams\" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling  and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor . Claude is surprised when he grabs a bottle of nerve tonic, only to open it and see it \"rise\" to the floor. Claude then becomes confused when he enters into the kitchen, where everything is still right-side up. Further driving Claude mad is when he looks out one window where an illusion is given to make Claude think he is upside down, and then looks out another to make him think he is sideways, and then out a third to make him believe that the house is under water. Finally broken, Claude runs, screaming, from the house and hiding into a nearby tree. Having accomplished their mission, Hubie and Bertie return down the fireplace, and roast cheese over an open fire as the cartoon fades out.',\n",

Father and daughter also have an incestuous relationship that has been going on for years. While at the casino in the company of his father, Maria Luisa meets Rodrigo Garcia Jalón, a rich old widower. Jalón, who is also a gambler, is smitten by Maria Luisa and begins to entice the young man into a relationship with her. He offers to provide for her generously if she becomes his lover. Maria Luisa sees the possibility of a life of freedom away from the tight rule of her father. She gleefully accepts Jalón's attention. When Captain Sánchez realizes what going on between the widower and Maria Luisa, he convinces his daughter to trap Jalón in one of their skims and blackmail him for a large amount of money. Following that plan, Maria Luisa invites her paramour to her house pretending to be alone. Captain Sánchez is hiding, waiting to trap the unsuspected Jalón. All is happening according to plan, but when the captain overhears the sincere love confession of Jalón for his daughter asking to marry him, he becomes outraged. In a fit of jealousy, the Captain grasps an ax and savagely kills Jalón. The hit of the ax beheads the body. The captain throws the severed head into the fire and hides the mutilated body on the cellar behind a wall. Maria Luisa, meanwhile, cleans the crime scene. They gained little money from the crime, except for a ring Jalón was wearing and a token from the casino for a large amount of money. The disappearance of Jalón causes intrigue among the people who knew him, particularly at the casino, where it is a well-known fact that he has not claimed the money from his gambling wins. Not very wisely, Maria Luisa goes to the casino trying to cash out the token, which immediately makes her a suspect. When the police come to search her house, they find the mutilated body hidden behind a wall in the cellar. Father and daughter are arrested. Maria Luisa, who initially denied any knowledge of the crime, later recants her story implicating her father. She also accuses him of sexually abusing her for many years. They had two children together who died shortly after birth. Captain Sánchez also talks against her daughter proclaiming his innocent, but he says the dishonor his daughter has brought upon him is more than he can bear and ask for the death penalty. During the trial, lawyers of daughter and father blamed each other. The captain is condemned to death and Maria Luisa is sentenced to 30 years in jail. After Captain Sánchez is executed in an open field, Maria Luisa receives the rosary her father held up to the end. A voiceover informs viewers that she eventually lost her sanity and died in prison twelve years after her father.\",\n",

The two meet for the first time, when Ben visits his friend, the actor George Raft, on a movie-studio set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay while his wife and two daughters remain in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Siegel is in California to muscle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna\\'s office one day, and is confronted by Siegel. Dragna claimed losses of $56,000; Cohen admits to robbing $42,000. Siegel theorizes he should be in business with the guy that did the robbery, not the guy that got robbed. Mickey Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Jack Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Ben, that Jack stole $14,000 from the New York Associates, and is told he now answers to Cohen. A humiliated and degraded Jack Dragna leaves the house. \"Everybody needs a fresh start,\" says Ben, to the departing Dragna. A suddenly quiet Ben Siegel returns to the dinner table to eat his cold scampi. After having had an earlier argument about Virginia\\'s sexual trysts with drummer Gene Krupa, and a variety of bull fighters, Virginia makes a romantic move on Ben, in the dining room. On a trip to Nevada to visit a dive gambling joint, Siegel comes up with the idea for a casino in the desert. He acquires funding from head mobster Meyer Lansky  and other New York mobsters who approve the deal for $1 million. The funds are approved when the associates make an unannounced visit to Siegel at his Scarsdale, New York Home. Ben is caught in the middle of preparations for his daughter Milllicent\\'s birthday celebration. His wife, Esta, is full of marital frustration; Daughter Millicent feels abandoned on her birthday; Associate Meyer Lansky is conflicted between wanting to fund Ben\\'s Casino-Hotel and worrying about Ben\\'s obsession with wanting to kill Mussolini. Bugsy puts Virginia in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada, but has no sense of control and the budget soon rises to $6 million. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets made, even selling his share of the casino and most of his belongings. Bugsy returns to the East Coast for the party for Charlie\\'s trip to Italy. Charlie says \"Congratulations Ben. Virginia will make a great wife. But I hope you know what you\\'re doing.\" Bugsy pummels Joey A. at the party, for a previous insult made regarding Virginia. Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has ratted out his old associates to save himself. Harry has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits, and being extorted by the prosecutors who want his testimony. Ben is Harry\\'s last and only friend. We don\\'t see Ben kill Harry, but there is a gunshot, while Virginia waits in the car. Ben and Esta are out to dinner in a restaurant with their two daughters. Ben suggests that maybe the anticipated move to California is not such a good idea. Esta and Ben have a confrontation in the women\\'s restroom, away from earshot of the children. \"You want a divorce! Say it!! You want a divorce!\" Esta screams in Ben\\'s face, slapping him several times. Ben has a guilty look on his face, as he watches their cab drive away from the restaurant. Bugsy is arrested for Harry Greenberg\\'s murder. But incarceration is short. The only witness is a cab-driver who dropped off Harry in front of Ben\\'s Beverly Hills house. The cab driver is escorted to the train station by Mickey Cohen. Meyer is waiting for Ben outside the jail. Meyer has a satchel of money that he gives to Ben. \"Charlie doesn\\'t have to know about it,\" he tells Ben. But he also tells Ben, \"I can\\'t protect you anymore.\" Upset about the costs, the fact that the casino is a failure, and that $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, Meyer Lansky asks Bugsy to meet him in Los Angeles. Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money but tells her to \"keep it and save it for a rainy day\" rather than return it. He then calls Lansky and tells him never to sell his share of the casino and that he\\'ll live to thank him someday. While in his home back in L.A. later that night, Bugsy is killed by several gunshots. Virginia is told the news back in Las Vegas and becomes upset, rushing out of the casino. The final text before the credits states that she returned the missing money a week later and committed suicide at some point after that. It also states that by 1991 the $6 million invested in Bugsy\\'s dream of Las Vegas had generated revenues of over $100 billion.',\n",

Jackie and Frank come to the children\\'s aid when they arrive back in Hudson Harbour, but no one believes their story except Frank. Steve sells one of the pieces of gold to a pawnbroker\\'s, and another to the street gang, and attempts to join, only to be humiliated and rejected. The children\\'s school science teacher, Sam Cohen, obtains the photos and discovers the children\\'s project. Eventually, colour begins to drain from the world and people either act aggressively towards each other or fall unconscious. The children, Frank, Jackie and Sam all deduce that due to Steve\\'s removal of the gold pieces, the rainbow has been damaged and caused colour, oxygen and photosynthesis to be drained, and all life could be threatened. The group split up to retrieve the gold pieces. Mike and Frank break into the pawnbroker\\'s and retrieve a piece of the gold, Tessy and Jackie gain results on where the next rainbow will appear, and Steve, Pete and Sam gain the other gold piece from the street gang. With time almost up, Mike, Steve and Mutt race out to the new rainbow\\'s landing site. Mike and Mutt are absorbed by a faulty rainbow, but Mike tosses the gold pieces back into it, restoring the rainbow and the world to normality. Mike and Mutt then end up in a tropical rainforest, as the film ends.',\n",

Tom hates New York and reluctantly accepts, but largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family\\'s secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah\\'s life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and an overly proud, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty. Tom is also torn with his own problems, but hides behind what he calls \"the Southern way\"; i.e., laughing about everything. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin having feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner and their relationship becomes closer. Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, along with his mother and sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom suffers a mental breakdown, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah\\'s troubled life. After a session of football, Herbert orders Bernard to return to his music lessons and prepare to leave for Tanglewood. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein\\'s home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom\\'s sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband\\'s affairs. Tom takes Herbert\\'s \"million dollar\" violin and threatens to throw it off the balcony unless Herbert apologizes. Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is about to be released from the hospital when Tom realizes that he wants to be closer to his wife and children, despite having fallen in love with someone else.

              " 'The Cat Piano is narrated by the main character of the animated short, an anthropomorphic cat. It is clear that the narration is a poem, which the poet is typing on a typewriter. In the beginning, we are introduced to his city\\'s love of music and musical prowess. The poet singles out one female singer of whom he is clearly enamored, quoting her singing as \"A voice that made all the angels of eternity sound ... tone deaf\". Shortly afterwards we are introduced to an overbearing structure beyond the sea, appearing to be a lighthouse. Its light quickly goes out, foreshadowing malevolence. Singers and musicians begin to disappear into thin air, \"Like sailors lost at sea\". As police investigate the missing cats, they find human shoeprints. The main character begins to explain the Cat Piano and its terrible function. We are informed that the Cat Piano is an instrument, much like any ordinary piano or harpsichord. The terrible reality is that instead of using strings and hammers to produce the desired noise, the Cat Piano produces noise by striking a nail into the tails of one or more cats that are caged in the piano. Immediately after discovering this, the main character rushes to warn the female singer, and arrives seconds too late. His heart broken, the city falls to pieces around him, fights break out, and music becomes forbidden. For a short while, the poet is tortured of thoughts of The Cat Piano, and can\\'t get the sounds of screaming cats out of his head. He motions shooting himself with his hand, and with the word \"Snap\", we are shown a glimpse of what appears to be a nightmare. In this nightmare, a dark humanoid figure holds up a cage with the afformentioned female singer and pricks her with a needle. The poet wakes up in a cold sweat and decides to take action. He observes the lighthouse from a hill, which now casts a red beam of light, and he can hear the terrible screams of the cats from a distance. A makeshift army of the city\\'s citizens is shown behind him. He and the army head over to the lighthouse in boats, and upon their arrival begin to scale the lighthouse. They break into the lighthouse, and we are given a glimpse of the mad pianist. The instrument he is playing resembles more of an organ than a piano, but nevertheless it is a terrifying torture machine equipped with hundreds of needles. The poet meets eyes with the singer, who is placed at the very top of the organ. The man playing the organ turns around, and the army of cats attacks him. They bite, scratch, and claw at him until he stumbles out of a window and falls to his death. They free the imprisoned cats, set fire to the lighthouse, and leave with the prisoners for home. The mood immediately becomes lighthearted again, as the city regains its artistic merit. The poet is sure to point out that he is no more famous or revered as he was before the incident - just an \"anonymity\". He is just glad to be able to listen to the sounds of music coming from the streets. As he finishes his typing, just before the story ends, the singer he was enamored with is seen in his room. She walks over to him and affectionately strokes his chin, implying a happy ending for the poet.',\n",

              " 'In a British Army \"glasshouse\"  in the Libyan Desert, prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination, being drunk whilst on duty, going AWOL or petty theft etc. are subjected to repetitive drill in the blazing desert heat. The arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies a power struggle erupts between brutal Staff Sergeant Williams , humane Staff Sergeant Harris , Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson , and the camp\\'s Medical Officer  as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles. Roberts  is a former Squadron Sergeant Major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his Commanding Officer - which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams brutality and serves as challenge to his authority. The RSM is a career soldier who sees his vital task as breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again, in his words, \"into men!\" Staff Sergeant Williams is new to the prison, and his ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. \"And what are you supposed to be,\" Roberts asks him when he is accused of cowardice in battle, \"a brave man in a permanent base job?\" The RSM seems to agree; in another scene, he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK  just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathizes with the men, too closely, according to the RSM. The officers of the piece, both the CO  and the Medical Officer, take their duties casually and, as Roberts points out, \"everyone is doing time here, even the screws.\" In the finale, the camp\\'s Medical Officer and Staff Sergeant Harris decide to report the abuses at the camp. Sadistic Staff Sergeant Williams goes to administer one final, perhaps fatal, beating to Sergeant Major Roberts, when two prisoners intervene and appear to beat Williams to death while Roberts pleads with them to stop.',\n",

Despite their best efforts, the Sand Ninja are slowly overwhelmed by the sheer strength of their mysterious opponents. The timely arrival of reinforcements led by Kankuro and Gaara turns the tide, with Kankuro slicing apart a suit of armor with his puppet, and Gaara dispatching a large number of enemies en masse with his signature Desert Imperial Funeral. However when Gaara orders the Sand Ninja to shine a flare at the retreating enemies, a large warship appears. The movie stars Naruto Uzumaki, Shikamaru Nara, and Sakura Haruno as they deliver a lost pet ferret  to its village. However, a mysterious knight called Temujin intercepts them and they fight, causing both Temujin and Naruto to be knocked off a cliff by the massive power caused by Naruto\\'s Rasengan and Temujin\\'s Rising Thunder. As Shikamaru and Sakura realize what has happened to Naruto, a giant ship appears. Naruto wakes up to find himself bandaged and traveling in a caravan led by Kahiko and Emina. He also finds Temujin asleep beside him. When Temujin awakens, Nerugui  seems to be attracted to him. The caravan is part of a moving country. Meanwhile, Sakura and Shikamaru split up to search for Naruto. Shikamaru spies on the fortress and finds a lab with children in capsules. Two women with similar armor to what Temujin was wearing are talking about the Gelel Stone. After watching the process, Shikamaru realizes that the soldiers are being created by placing the souls of children in different bodies. The movie revolves mostly around a special mineral called the Gelel Stone, which has a strong and mysterious power. There was once a clan that could control the stone\\'s powers , but they were destroyed because of fights for the stone. Temujin is working for his Lord, Master Haido, who has his group searching for the Stones of Gelel, so that he can create a \\'utopia\\', a world free from war and strife. But he also tells his group that sacrifices are for the greater good. When Naruto meets Haido, he at first believes him. Naruto accompanies Temujin, Ranke, and Fugai to the area where the fight between the Sand Ninjas and Haido\\'s forces took place. During the fight, Kamina duels with Kankuro while Ranke fights Gaara. When Ranke is killed by Gaara, Kamina escapes. The caravan that Naruto was saved by has been attacked as Fugai threatens Kahiko for the location of the Stones of Gelel. Shikamaru and Sakura end up repelling her. Temujin learns that Kahiko knows where the Stones of Gelel are. When he tries to capture Kahiko, he is subdued by Shikamaru\\'s Shadow Possession Jutsu as Naruto catches up. Shikamaru interrogates Temujin about Haido\\'s plot. After Shikamaru manages to get some answers, Temujin uses a smokescreen and kidnaps Kahiko and one of the children from the caravan. Temujin forces Kahiko to lead him to a cave where the stones are sealed away. Naruto follows him to try to stop him with Nerugui leading the way. Temujin sends the kid he abducted on his way as he has Kahiko lead him into the cave. But Haido, Fugai, and Kamina also follow him to the cave. This leads to a confrontation between Haido and Naruto\\'s group as Naruto finally realizes Haido\\'s evil intentions. He is disgusted that Haido and his followers are willing to sacrifice their friends and other innocents for their cause. He angrily yells that dreams that sacrifice friends are nothing but garbage, surprising Temujin. Kahiko triggers a mechanism that takes himself and Temujin to the chamber below, where the entrance to the mines of Gelel are, with the intent to destroy them. Haido angrily follows with several armed soldiers after smacking Naruto aside. Kamina challenges Shikamaru, and Sakura challenges Fugai before the latter can follow Haido with the ship. Naruto follows after Kahiko, Temujin, and Haido. Once there, Haido reveals that he has a piece of Gelel Stone which he uses to attack Kahiko. Eventually Temujin, surprised by Haido\\'s cruel words and behavior, defends Kahiko, which angers Haido. Eventually Naruto shows up and saves Kahiko. Temujin is finally so appalled by Haido\\'s willingness to kill Naruto and Kahiko and call it a \"noble sacrifice\" that he refuses to kill them when Haido orders him to. He realizes that the shadowy figure he had seen in the ruins of his house after his parents\\' death was Haido. Haido then admits that he was the one that killed Temujin\\'s family and then used their son like a pawn for all those years. He then attacks Temujin and destroys his piece of Gelel Stone by shoving his hand into his body, tossing him aside and leaving him lying on the ground, weak and horrified by what he has done. At this point Naruto intervenes and attempts to defeat Haido. Naruto manages to hit Haido with his Rasengan,which blasts him into the ceiling. But the ceiling starts to leak chakra from the Mines of Gelel and heal Haido\\'s wounds. Haido then shoots a blast of chakra at Naruto and Temujin which is blocked by some soldiers who were Temujin\\'s old friends. Naruto then creates a rasengan in one hand, and Temujin makes one in the other, which combined kill Haido. Haido crashes into the key to the mines of Gelel which causes a chain reaction which begins to destroy the surrounding area. Kahiko says the only way to stop the destruction is to summon a space-time rift to destroy the mines of Gelel and the summoner. Temujin offers to do it and begins to walk towards a summoning spot, ignoring Naruto\\'s words. When the space time rift is summoned, Naruto attempts to pull Temujin out and saves him. Naruto was thinking about what happened to Sasuke and did not want history to repeat itself. Later, Temujin leaves with the other children stating that he will end all war. Kahiko is sad that Nerugui is going with Temujin. The credits show Naruto and Temujin seeing each other one last time as Temujin\\'s ship leaves and make fists of victory.',\n",

Mike invites people over to his house to determine the rightful owner by posting an add in the newspaper stating \"lost & found winning lottery ticket for 67 million dollars.\" Naturally many people showed up but the original owner had written something on the back of the ticket giving Mr. Brady a way to tell who was telling the truth. With no one being able to come up with the phrase written, Mr. Brady starts to think of another way, and just as he says he doesn\\'t know what to do, a local female news caster walks in, and Mr. Brady sees it as a way to reach more people. Multiple cut scenes ensue showing stations talking about the Bradys trying to find the original owner, while also showing a broadcast talking about the vice president resigning to work for the company Fox, where he\\'ll make six times the amount he was making, in the background it shows the actual owner walking to his death by execution -this is implied by the man being in chains, escorted by law enforcement dressed people, and a clergy man speaking to him, while the man shouts, \"Wait, I\\'m the real owner, I\\'m rich, take your hands off me.\" With not being able to find the original owner Mr. Brady donates the money to \"homeless architects and their families\", which garners the attention of the president. The president then invites him to a press conference where the president is asked about his dealings with an oil drilling company abusing the environment, the president responds by saying he has never heard of the company, has not dealt with them, nor has he been to the site, where he then states, \"This is the truth or I shall resign my presidency.\" The press then goes on to ask if he has picked a new running mate for the upcoming election, and with the light of ongoing scandals can he find an honest man of high integrity. Carol, Mike Brady\\'s wife, shouts out why not Mike, where then the press shouts, \"Yeah, why not Mike,\" and the president says, \"Why not Mike Brady.\" It then cuts to a news station stating that the incumbent president and Mike Brady have won the election -with Mike Brady the vice president- due to boy scouts, disco music lovers, and polyester enthusiasts. The next scene in which the incumbent president and Mike are to be sworn in, a confidential document folder is passed to the incumbent president. The folder contains a picture of the incumbent president at the drilling site, with -what is inferred- the oil company\\'s top executives, the president remembering his promise then walks out before being sworn in, thereby making Mike Brady president. Mike Brady then needs to select a new vice president, which he decides it should be his wife. He goes before congress asking for a vote, where the speaker of the house says, \"You cannot just call for a vote, the vice president has very real responsibilities and cannot vote unless he sees something to prove she can do it.\" Carol then breaks out in song along with the rest of the family, convincing congress to vote for her. As Mike Brady is walking to the oval office different departments come to him with negative scores asking for more money or negligible increases asking for money, with which he replies, \"Not good enough\" including when his youngest daughter asks for him to sign her report card, although approving the congress\\'s new budget plan. Veronica, the liaison to the American public pulls the speaker of the house into a separate room, saying, \"Can you believe him, he just approved your budget, he\\'s not taking any credit, and he\\'s of to much integrity, how did he get to the highest office, you should be president.\" A side plot is Peter breaking a priceless Ming vase, and trying to get out of it by gluing it back together. Peter really wants to go to a camp, but feels if he tells the truth he won\\'t be able to go. The vase is used during a diner party with dignitaries across the world, but ends up leaking all over them. Peter\\'s siblings come up with the plan of all of them confessing, hoping to fool/confuse Mike Brady into not knowing who actually broke it. Mike thinking about it logically though realized Peter was the only one not to confess thereby showing his own guilt. Mike coming up with the consequence of punishing the other children forcing Peter into a guilt trip to confess his own guilt, ultimately succeeding. Veronica, Greg\\'s crush is later to be found as an agent of an elitist organization who\\'s mission is seizing power for herself and the speaker of the house. They both devise a plan to ruin the presidents image, and therefore presidency The first plan consisting of Veronica seducing Greg into divulging crude or malevolent information, on Mike or the family, fails, but the youngest daughter does give information regarding a questionable relationship between Mike Brady and a woman from his past; Carol is accused of rebellious behavior from protesting to keep a park; Marcia is accused of being promiscuous because of a fictional erotic encounter with Desi Arnaz Jr. written in her diary; Greg accused of under age smoking because of a cigaret container found in his coat, he had switched with another boy; Peter accused of bribery for getting a better grade after calling his teacher great; Jan accused of cheating for getting a better grade on an essay than she was supposed to; and Alice accused of drugging the food so the Bradys stay happy all the time. Although this plan garners significant news coverage its is by no means to impeach a president, in which they devise a second plan in order to seize power. The second plan is to trick the president into addressing the public that a world ending asteroid is about to hit earth. They succeed by switching a report from NASA regarding data from the Trailblazer 1 space probe -a fictional space probe- with Peter\\'s science project about the asteroid that hit earth causing the largest scale extinction on earth. This plan also succeeds and Mike address the public telling them he received a report from NASA that confirms a massive meteor is on an intersect course and will cause global devastation.

Mike then asks Cindy to tell the press what she heard the Speaker of the House say, to which she somehow tells the story of her seeing the Speaker of the House switching the homework and the report.

Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid , a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny , seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys. In his youth, Munny was a bandit who was notorious for being a vicious, cold-blooded murderer, but he is now a repentant widower raising two children and has sworn off alcohol. Though Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, his farm is failing, putting his children\\'s future in jeopardy. Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid. On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan , another retired gunfighter who reluctantly leaves his wife  to go along. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob  and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp , arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. The next morning Bob is ejected from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill, who has impressed him with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the inner workings of a gunfighter\\'s psyche. Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later amid a rain storm and go to the saloon/whorehouse to discover the cowboys\\' location. Munny has a bad fever after riding in the rain, and is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him. Little Bill has no idea who Munny is, and after finding a pistol on him he beats him brutally and kicks him out onto the street. Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting \"advances\" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window. The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health. Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting&nbsp;– although it becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan decides to return home while Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys\\' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him. After they escape, a very distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before, and renounces the gunfighter lifestyle. When Little Sue  meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill\\'s men and tortured to death, but not before giving up the identities of his two accomplices. The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan\\'s families, while Munny drinks half a bottle of whisky and heads into town to take revenge on Bill. That night, Logan\\'s corpse is displayed in a coffin outside the saloon. Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid. Munny walks in alone and promptly kills Skinny Dubois ([[Anthony James , the saloon owner and pimp. After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead. Munny orders everyone out before stopping Little Bill from reaching for his pistol. Bill curses Munny before the latter finishes him with a final gunshot. Munny then threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving town, warning that he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any prostitutes are further harmed. The final scene is a bookend shot of Munny\\'s farm, and of Munny paying a final visit to his wife\\'s grave. The epilogue text that follows reads that Munny and his family were rumored to have moved to San Francisco and \"prospered in dry goods\".',\n",

Prince Udayan , Raja's nephew, is handsome, brave and intelligent than Devan ([[Madhu Raja's elder nephew. Both love each other as close brothers. Udayan's powerful tactics and superior military skills saved the kingdom from attacks by the Kompan Dacoits. Raja named Udayan as his successor to the throne. Despite Prince Devan's seniority, he welcomed the decision. Devan secretly admired Raja's daughter Parvathi  and hoped to marry her. Princess Parvathi was in love with Prince Udayan and Raja agreed to allow Parvathi to marry Udayan. Devan felt betrayed. Nevertheless, he did not oppose the decision. On the other hand, 2 nobles, Kammaran  and Perumana Kurup  were upset by Udayan's ascension because they feared he would expose the nobles corrupt and scandalous actions. Using Devan's secret love for Parvati, Kammaran turned Devan against Prince Udayan and Devan joined the conspiracy to keep Udayan out of the country so he could not ascend to the throne. Kammaran and Kompan Dacoits staged a royal pardon and a peace treaty, and insisted that Prince Udayan, as the crown prince, must come to sign the treaty. Believing this move would ensure permanent peace in his Kingdom, Prince Udayan agreed to come in person to sign, even it was on his wedding eve. Prince Udayan at Kompan's camp was betrayed by his own soldiers who were arranged by Kammaran and he was taken into Kompan's captivity. However news flashed in the country as Prince Udayan betrayed Kolathiri Raja and killed some of the Raja's men. This made the Raja furious, who declared Udayan as a traitor and cancelled the marriage. Kompan instructs his men to kill Udayan. However they decided to sell him as a slave to a cruel captain of a slave ship. Thus he became a slave, toiling hard amidst cruelties inflicted upon him. While as a slave, he meets another slave, Kunjali , from whom he learnt the death of Kolathiri Raja and his queen at Ali Raja's boat camp by forces arranged by Kammaran and Kompan. Kunjali was the trusted slave of Ali Raja, who tried to save the Kolathiri Raja and his queen, but he was killed by Perumana Kurup by stabbing at his back. He saved Ali Raja's daughter, Lalia and vast treasures that was secretly stored at the basement, with the help of his men, however could not escape himself from the Kompan's men, who sold him as slave to Kapithan's ship. From Kunjali, Udayan came to know the place where the treasures of Ali Raja and his daughter were taken to a safe area. In the meantime, Prince Devan married Princess Paravathi and became the new Kolathiri Raja. However the Royal crown and staff were missing. Though Devan was a good raja, the actual powers of administration were in the hands of Kammaran and Perumana Kurup, who ran the state with heavy corruption and high-handedness which Devan was unaware of. After some years, Udayan and his fellow slave prisoners staged a coup in the ship, killing the captain and releasing themselves. Udayan ran away, became a rich Arab merchant after finding the lost treasures of Ali Raja and his daughter Lalia . Both decided to make a return to Kolathiri Kingdom in disguise to make their revenge. They return to the Kolathiri kingdom in a floating palace as an Arab Prince and Princess. Years made people to forget Udayan and no one was able to recognize him in his new attire and lifestyle, except for Queen Parvathi, who understood him in just a glimpse. King Devan and Queen Parvathi has one son, Prince Chandra ([[Shankar  who fell in love with Laila. Meanwhile Udayan was hatching a plot to trap Perumana Kurup, after coming to know that the crown and staff of Kolathiri Raja was in his custody . Udayan approached Perumana Kurup and let him know that he is interested in purchasing rare Jewels and crowns, at an astronomical price. Perumana Kurup brought the crown and staff out of hiding to sell it. However he was caught red-handed by the public and brought before trial. At the trial, he declared that the old raja gifted the crown and staff to him, for attempting to rescue the king from attack and he challenged the prosecutors that they have no evidence against him for betray and robbery. It was at this moment Lalia enters into court room, to declare her true identity as Princess Laila – the heir apparent of Ali Raja, who was the sole eye-witness to the incident. This made Perumana Kurup to commit suicide, when he tries to run away. Udayan's second target was Kammaran. Kammaran is the new finance minister of the state. The kingdom was facing extreme financial crisis due to mismanagement and corruption. Kammaran advises the king to seek financial assistance from the visiting Arab prince. Devan commissions Kammaran to hold talks with Arab Prince. Kammaran pays visit at the Udayan's palace, to seek finance, without understanding his true identity. Udayan refused to finance, rather says that he would finance if Kammaran becomes king. This offer made Kammaran greedy and he hatches a plan to trap Devan, similar to the way who he trapped Udayan earlier. In meantime Udayan double-crosses Kammaran, by sending a message to the Devan directly that he is ready to finance. This made Devan suspicious of Kammaran and secretly through his spies he understands the plot his close friend Kammaran made to trap him. Kammaran repeats the old strategy with assistance of the Kompan dacoits who asked the king to come directly with a tribute in order to prevent an attack. Devan along with a few soldiers handpicked by Kammaran, went to Kompan's camp with a treasure chest. However much to their surprise, instead of tribute, soldiers were hiding inside the chest, who attacked Kompan and killed Kammaran's soldiers. In meantime a large army of Devan stormed into the place, routing Kammaran's plans. Devan's army tried to capture Kammaran, but he was rescued by Udayan's soldiers. It was in Udayan's camp, Kammaran understood the true identity of Udayan and he was fired by Udayan's soldiers. Udayan's final revenge is now against Devan and he was planning on that. In meantime Prince Chandran through his close friend Kannan  who was Kammaran's son, came to know the double cross made by Udayan. He understood, it was Udayan who spoiled the relationships between Kammaran and Devan and challenged Udayan for a public duel, which Udayan accepts. That night a mysterious lady figure enters into Udayan's palace, which was Queen Parvathi, pleading for her son's life to Udayan. Udayan refuses, as he said that it was Prince Chandran to declared duel against him and he can't quit it. Queen Parvathi said that she understood it was Udayan in disguise and pleaded him considering her love earlier. Udayan promises that he won't kill Chandran. Prince Chandran saw his mother coming out of Udayan's Palace, which made him furious. He questioned his mother. It was then revealed by Paravathi to Chandran, that he is actually Udayan's son born to Parvathi. This made Chandran surrender to Udayan, while at the duel. Hearing his son's surrender without a fight made King Devan furious, who went to Udayan's palace to challenge him. It was there, for first time after his betrayal, Devan saw Udayan, which made him to fall down. When Udayan was about to kill Devan, Parvathi rushes and stops him, saying that Devan has paid for his sins, by raising up Chandra despite of knowing that he was the son of Udayan. This made Udayan to forget his revenge and he forgives Devan. He decides to leave. Hearing that the king has fallen, the Kompan dacoits raided the palace. As the king had fallen and attack was unexpected, the Kolathiri forces were overrun by the Kompan Army. However timely intervention of Udayan's army, killed Kompan and all his men. He took the crown and gave it to Devan and blessed all of them. When Devan asked Udayan to stay back, he said he has to go back, however gifted his stepdaughter Lalia to Chandran who was in love with her.\",\n",

              " 'The story takes place in Edwardian England. Three families represent three social classes: the Wilcoxes are wealthy capitalists, the class that is displacing the aristocracy; the Schlegel sisters represent the enlightened bourgeoisie; and the Basts are in the lower middle class.  The film asks the question \\'Who will inherit England?\\' and answers it through the ownership of the house, Howards End, as it passes from person to person. At the start of the film, the younger sister, Helen Schlegel , rashly becomes engaged to the younger Wilcox son, Paul. The next day both realise their mistake and break it off, but Helen has told her older sister, who tells her family. Her Aunt Juley  arrives at Howards End and so makes the Wilcox family aware of the engagement. Later, when the Wilcox family takes a house near to the Schlegels in London, the sister, Margaret Schlegel , feels compelled to visit because of the social embarrassment of the previous year. She befriends the mother, Ruth Wilcox . Ruth is descended from English yeoman stock and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes own Howards End, a house which she loves dearly and which is the symbol of rural England and English tradition. Over the course of a few months, the two women become close friends, and Ruth sees in Margaret a kindred spirit. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels\\' London house is due to expire, and knowing she is soon to die, Ruth bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation for the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her \"right mind\" or intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper that Ruth\\'s bequest is written on, and decide to keep her will secret. Because he knows that he has prevented the Schlegels from finding a home in Howards End, Henry Wilcox  offers to help Margaret find a new place to live. As a result, the two become close and Henry proposes. Margaret accepts. The Schlegels befriend a young, poor, yet intellectual clerk, Leonard Bast . Wishing to improve his lot, they pass along advice from Henry that Leonard should leave his post because his company is heading for a crash. Leonard does so, but finds himself in a worse position and eventually unemployed. The two plotlines converge at the marriage party of Evie Wilcox . Helen has found the Basts starving and brings them to the party. Jacky Bast  becomes drunk; Margaret approaches her with Henry to find out who she is. Jacky recognises Henry and it becomes clear that years previously he had had an affair with her. Humiliated and suspicious, Henry breaks off the engagement, but that evening he and Margaret reconcile and she forgives his sexual impropriety. In accordance with Henry\\'s wishes, she insists that Helen take the Basts away and refuses them help. Because of this, the Schlegel sisters drift apart. Helen has a brief affair with Leonard Bast. She becomes pregnant, and leaves the country, telling none of her condition. When Helen returns to take her possessions, she asks if she can stay one night at Howards End. When Henry Wilcox finds out that Helen is pregnant, he insists that she cannot stay in the house, and that the man responsible must be found out and punished for dishonouring her. Margaret and Henry argue bitterly about the different standards of sexual propriety applied to men and women, and Margaret says she is leaving Henry. Margaret, Leonard and the oldest Wilcox son Charles  all make their way separately to Howards End and the final tragedy unfolds: Charles attacks and inadvertently kills Leonard, and is arrested. Henry\\'s pride is shaken; his feelings break through at last, and he and Margaret become truly close. Ultimately, Ruth Wilcox\\'s wish is fulfilled: Henry leaves Howards End to Margaret upon his death. Helen is reconciled with Margaret, and Helen will raise her son as heir. In both film and novel, the final ownership of Howards End is a symbol of new class relations in England: the wealth of the new industrialists  married to the politically reforming vision of liberalism  that will benefit the children of the lower classes .',\n",

              " 'The movie focuses on the media\\'s coverage of news, and whether covering the news changes it. The film has no opening credits . Instead, the program begins with a promo for a typical daytime network lineup: previews of a game show and soap opera are shown, along with a catchy jingle, \"RBS: We\\'re Moving Up!\" Suddenly, an ominous \"Special Bulletin\" slide appears on the screen, with an announcer saying \"We interrupt this program to bring you a Special Bulletin from RBS News.\" It shows how a local TV crew, covering a dockworkers\\' strike, become caught in the middle of a firefight between the U.S. Coast Guard and a tugboat sitting at a dock in Charleston, South Carolina. After several Coast Guard personnel are wounded, the Coast Guardsmen, apparently outgunned, surrender and are taken hostage, as are the reporter and cameraman. The reporter is asked to televise a statement by the terrorists of their demands: the delivery to them of every nuclear trigger device at the U.S. Naval Base in Charleston, so that they can be taken out to sea and destroyed. Without these special triggers, the nuclear weapons on the naval warships and nuclear-powered submarines based at Charleston, to include the Fleet Ballistic Missile  submarines, cannot be used. The terrorists reveal that they have constructed their own nuclear device—one roughly equivalent in strength to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. Their device is set to detonate within 24 hours if the demand is not met. It is also equipped with anti-tampering devices that will set it off if any attempt is made to move or disarm it. As the faux news broadcast continues, details about the terrorists slowly begin to emerge as the broadcast hosted by Susan Myles  and veteran newscaster John Woodley  continues. The group is led by Dr. Bruce Lyman , a scientist and former designer of nuclear weapons for the American government who had recently been imprisoned for taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations. His cohorts include David McKeeson  a nuclear scientist who stole weapons grade plutonium from the Hanford nuclear research facility in Richland, Washington and constructed the bomb; a bank robber whom Lyman met in jail; a poet and anti-war activist implicated in a bombing that killed several people a decade earlier; and a meek housewife and mother of two who had been friends with Lyman back in college. Several times during the program, Woodley finds himself debating with Lyman and his colleagues the ethics of television journalism and the role it plays in both covering the activities of terrorists and, at the same time, inadvertently promoting such activities. \"TV news is essentially show business,\" says McKeeson during a particularly heated exchange with Woodley. At first the government chooses to ignore and underplay the story. McKeeson eventually reveals his device, which is kept in the ship\\'s lower hold, to RBS\\'s cameraman. The scientist describes it as an Implosion-type nuclear weapon and ominously warns viewers that he designed the bomb to detonate should anyone try to tamper with it or move it. As facts come out indicating the threat being real, various public announcements occur, culminating with the decision to order the evacuation of the downtown Charleston area, which causes a public panic. The Government later announces, just shortly before the terrorist\\'s deadline, that it would accede to their demands. A van rolls up to the tugboat, allegedly containing the first load of triggers that they had demanded. In the interim, the terrorists, who are still holding the RBS reporter and cameraman, become suspicious when the TV on which they are monitoring the RBS broadcast suddenly goes blank, supposedly due to a transmitter power failure at the local station. In fact, the signal was cut-off to mask the arrival of a Delta Force team sneaking aboard the tugboat . In the ensuing gun battle, all but two of the terrorists are killed by the commandos. The journalists survive without major injury. McKeeson commits suicide before he can be captured. The remaining terrorist is taken into custody. All this occurs a little over an hour prior to the detonation time of the bomb. Members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team  enter the boat in an attempt to defuse the bomb. The reporter and cameraman remain to comment on their efforts, despite pleas from the news anchor in New York City that they leave the area. Over a remote camera installed on the tugboat, the NEST team is shown having an argument over how to bypass McKeeson\\'s many safeguards. Abruptly, the NEST team gets into a heated argument. At the studio, an expert, Dr. Nils Johannsen, brought in by RBS  says that there are conventional explosives in the device, geared to set up the chain reaction. \"They have just put a match under the whole pile!\" he says. The members of the NEST team are shown working frantically, then breaking into a panic just before the signal is abruptly broken. Static fills the screen and contact Charleston is lost. The network switches back to the main RBS newsroom in New York, which is initially in confusion, the broadcast image briefly going to a test pattern. Woodley at first shows annoyance, looking around at staffers and angrily barking out \"Somebody get me some information, dammit! What the hell is this?\" then falls silent and stunned as he realizes what has probably happened. Myles, nervous and cautious, merely advises viewers that they \"seem to have lost contact\" with Charleston. After considerable effort to reestablish contact, the anchors manage to get hold of Megan \"Meg\" Barclay , a reporter for the local RBS television affiliate station in Charleston, WPIV, who was two miles from the tugboat aboard the aircraft carrier museum ship USS Yorktown across Charleston Harbor on the opposite bank of the Cooper River in Mount Pleasant. In the midst of wreckage aboard the aircraft carrier, with huge fires blazing in downtown Charleston in the background and clearly stunned and dazed, she expresses fear of imminent radiation sickness. Her cameraman, who has also survived, reveals that he was recording a few moments earlier and they ask him to rewind and play back the recording. The tape shows Barclay standing in front of a relatively normal looking harbor overlooking the tugboat, facing the camera, her back to the boat. We then see an enormous bright light coming from the other side of the harbor. As the camera lens recovers from the sudden flash of light, we catch a brief glimpse of a mushroom cloud rising over the shoreline, followed by a huge blast of wind that blows through and knocks the camera over. The tape ends. The cameraman then pans the harbor which is now nothing but a firestorm. At this, Myles breaks down, saying \"Oh, my God!\" on the air. More chaos is revealed in Charleston itself: scenes of fires , destruction and wounded people. It is revealed that the government\\'s intention was to play for time until the Delta Force team could be put on the ship, on the assumption the nuclear response team could defuse the nuclear weapon. Now, local authorities and the government have to deal with the destruction of a city, and after showing scenes of mass destruction farther out from the blast, a tearful John Woodley can only say \"This is a very dark moment\" as the image fades to black. The film then moves ahead three days to reveal the aftermath of the explosion. Thanks to the evacuation, the immediate death toll was less than 2,000; however, another 25,000 suffer severe injuries, including about 4,800 severe burn cases, at a time when the total number of burn unit beds in the United States numbers only about 2,400. Some half a million are left homeless due to inland fallout and the region is expected to be uninhabitable for decades. At this point, the broadcast shifts its attentions from the destruction of Charleston to cover other chaotic subjects around the world such as  which have continued to occur despite the destruction of Charleston.',\n",

In flashbacks, we do not only see Huang in his Tokyo studio, or attending an exhibition of his works, or on the steamship mentioned, looking forward to an encounter with his father, mother, and elder brother. We also see Huang as a boy and adolescent, growing up on the island of Penghu, situated in the Taiwan Straits. It is here that we encounter him as a dreaming but also rebellious youth, in love with a girl from a poor family that he could never have married. We also learn about his father, a businessman who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps as a pharmacist and therefore did not support him anymore when Ching-cheng decided to become an artist. The narration switches between present and past. An important strand of the narration is focused on the restoration of 'lost' works created by the artist that were discovered recently - a difficult task that is carefully accomplished by a young, physically handicapped  art restorer. The movie is also focused on the young art restorer’s search for traces of Huang , and on her attempt to reconstruct aspects of his biography. The film is a celebration of regional South Taiwan culture, of the land, its people and their contribution to the common Chinese heritage. Incidentally, Ching-cheng Huang is a relative of the filmmaker Yu-shan Huang.\",\n",

              " 'Charlie Simms  is a student at an exclusive New England prep school. Unlike most of his peers, Charlie was not born to a wealthy family. To pay for a flight home for Christmas, Charlie accepts a temporary job over Thanksgiving weekend looking after retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade , who Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous blind alcoholic. Charlie and George Willis, Jr. , another student at the preparatory school, witness several students setting up a prank for the school\\'s headmaster Trask . Following the prank, Trask presses Charlie and George to divulge the names of the perpetrators. When Charlie refuses to talk, Trask offers a bribe, a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to Harvard. Charlie continues to remain silent but appears conflicted. Shortly after Charlie arrives, Slade unexpectedly whisks Charlie off on a trip to New York City. Slade reserves a room at the Waldorf-Astoria. During dinner at an upscale restaurant, Slade glibly states the goals of the trip, which involve enjoying luxurious accommodations in New York before committing suicide. Charlie is taken aback and does not know if Slade is serious. They pay an uninvited surprise visit to Slade\\'s brother\\'s home for Thanksgiving dinner. Slade is an unpleasant surprise for the family, as he deliberately provokes everyone and the night ends in acrimony. During this time the reason behind Slade\\'s blindness is also revealed. As they return to New York, Charlie tells Slade about his complications at school. Slade advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that Willis will probably be pressured into not maintaining silence. Later at a restaurant, Charlie and Slade observe Donna , a beautiful young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Slade leads Donna in a spectacular tango  on the dance floor. That night, he hires an escort. Deeply despondent the next morning, Slade responds to Charlie\\'s suggestion that they test drive a Ferrari.

For his defense, Willis has enlisted the help of his wealthy father, and divulges the names of the perpetrators, qualifying that his vision wasn\\'t clear. When pressed for more details, Willis passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie\\'s expulsion. At this, Slade cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and questioning the integrity of a system that rewards informing on classmates. He tells them that Charlie has shown integrity in his actions and for the committee to not expel him because this is what great leaders are made of and he will make them proud in the future.

              " ' The American oyster King dictates to a room full of typing writing women. He smokes a large cigar held by one of his many butlers at his side. One butler scurrys in to say, “Your daughter is in a fit of raging madness” Ossi, in the other room, has destroyed the room by throwing everything onto the floor. Mister Quaker oddly jogs through the house to see Ossi on the other side of the mansion. When Mister Quaker peeps in, Ossi throws newspapers at him. He asks, “Why are you throwing those newspapers?” and the brat replies with, “Because all of the vases are broken.” Ossi is clearly angered, and in a big mess. She shows her father a newspaper that says the Shoe cream king’s daughter has married to a count. This is what Ossi is upset about. Mister Quaker is not impressed but tells Ossi that he will buy her a prince. With this, Ossi can’t contain herself, jumps up, and hugs her dad ever so enthusiastically. She is so happy, she could smash the house with joy! We then meet Seligson, the matchmaker, who is dealing with a woman with a turned up nose. She complains about the price and how all of the bachelors have imperfections. She then leaves unsatisfied. As she exits, Ossi enters the room smiling and hands the matchmaker a note from Mister Quaker. It says, that because of the shoe cream king’s daughter is married, and because oysters are more important, then his daughter should be married too. She needs a man with a family tree that is in accordance with the Oyster king’s. The matchmaker searches his wall full of bachelors and comes across Prince Nucki. Nucki lives high up in a building on the 47th floor, he has heavy debts, and is not inclined to marriage. With the great match, the matchmaker leaves instantly. Meanwhile, Ossi is instructed in the ways or marriage which happen to be all about babies. Her instructor is a strict looking woman in black with thin glasses and hair ever so tightly pulled back. Ossi bathes the doll and shakes it off to dry it. She is yelled at for not holding it correctly, and Ossi snaps back at the teacher and continues to shake off the doll. Then, she is instructed to powder the baby, but unknowingly powders its face. Ossi is so confused about why she should powder its bottom that she exclaims, “that’s funny.” She goes to touch the bottom but disgusted, tosses the naked doll behind her, across the room, and proceeds to throw powder puff at the instructor. We enter the small flat of Prince Nucki where he and his friend Josef, both in nice dress suits, are hand washing clothes and hanging the wet clothes around the flat to dry on lines. The matchmaker comes to meet Nucki. When he rings the bell, Nucki and Josef look at each other in a fright and begin to take off all of their rings, and other nice materials, thinking it might be their poorer friends, but when Josef sees that it is Seligson, they hurry to put on all of the rings and jewelry they just took off. Josef greets the matchmaker and tells him that he will see if the ‘highness’ will see him. “In the meantime, take a seat on the banister,” Josef says. When he goes back in, the two of them scamper around to fix up the place to make it look decent, and start throwing things off screen. When Seligson enters, Nucki is upon a throne of an old chair and a wooden box. Seligson tells Nucki that he’s got a nice match. He tells Nucki that the light-haired Ossi has hair as black as night, to which Nucki shakes his head but who cares when the girl has that much money. Nucki decides that he needs to send his adjutant to look at her. Josef and Nucki can\\'t believe that the matchmaker actually believed them. They fix Josef up in a suit and top hat. Back at the Quakers, Ossi grows impatient after a grueling hour and a half of waiting. She is all flustered so she snags Mister Quakers paper out of his hands, but he must be used to this because he simply pulls another out of his pocket. Ossi declares that if she doesn’t have a husband in five minutes, she’ll demolish the house. To this, Mister Quaker welcomes her to it and hands her a vase to smash. To his invitation she breaks a mirror with the vase, but Mister Quaker calmly replies, “ I’m not Impressed.”  Josef shows up at the Quakers. Upon arrival, all of the waiters, butlers and other workers of the house standing at attention, bow to Josef and then take away his hat and cane in a hurry. One asks for his card, and after a few moments of fumbling around his borrowed coat, he gives Nucki’s card to the butler. This is where all of the confusion starts. When she gets the card, Ossi becomes so excited to know the prince is there. Josef waits in the unusually large drawing room where you can\\'t even see the ceiling. Quaker is taken to his room to sleep while Ossi is readied. This is a long process. Ossi does nothing to get herself ready, because she just has all of her maids do it for her. She is carried from room to room on a conveyor belt of women. Josef begins pacing around the room, faster and faster. Josef is startled at how quickly ten servants show up after pushing a single button. Josef is impatient, and Quaker is not impressed at all. By the time Ossi is finally ready, both Quaker and Josef are asleep. She walks in, looking quite similar to before, takes one look at Josef, and says, “Good Lord, he looks stupid!” But this doesn’t stop the marriage-thirsty Ossi, and she rushes them off to be wed in a hurry. She doesn’t even bother to wake her father, or introduce him to her soon to be husband. The two ride off in a carriage drawn by 10 horses. Ossi wants a quick marriage so they visit a priest at his house and have the ceremony through his window, where Josef doesn’t even say a word for Ossi declares that he has nothing to say anyways. After the quick I do, they pay the priest, and rush off, back to the Quaker house. When Ossi introduces her new husband to the servants, they boil over with laughter. Josef then is sent to introduce himself to Quaker, but when he asks how to get there, all he gets is a ridiculously large sized map and a friendly, “Bon Voyage!” Josef is mistaken for a butler and is ordered to blow Quakers nose. When Quaker finds out that he isn’t a butler but really his son-in-law, he states, “I’m not impressed.”  On account of the hurry, the wedding celebration includes only the closest family members. Dozens upon dozens of waiters, butlers, and chefs rush around to prepare a feast for the 50 closest family members. There are lines and lines of waiters waiting to serve the guests. Josef is in heaven and is scarfing food and chugging his drinks. Mister Quaker makes a toast, “Excuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law,” to show his feelings about the new member of the family. Ossi punches Josef and tells him so ironically to not be so greedy. Josef’s toast is short, saying that he hasn’t had that much to eat in a while. \"A Foxtrot Epidemic Suddenly Breaks Out During The Wedding\" There is a gigantic band and a wide dance floor in one room where the Foxtrotters enter and dance around. The band has an animated bandmaster who likes to move around, and shake his stuff. As everyone dances, Ossi dances alone. Quaker tells her to not dance so unrestrained, but she thinks that’s rubbish and continues to dance. At this point, every person in the house is dancing, even the workers. The kitchen has become another dance floor. Ossi dances with a waiter, and Quaker dances with a guest. The band plays on with its unique instruments such as the man slapping another man on the beat. Josef in the other room, continues to gorge himself with food and drinks. While Josef is enjoying himself thoroughly, Nucki is at home eating his usual, pickled herring. His friends barge in and ask him to come along on a spree. At the end of the party, Quaker is tired and sweating like a pig, and Josef is happily still up drinking, sitting in a room filled with his empty bottles. He can barely walk, but somehow makes to the bedroom where Ossi goes in her room and sends him to the other. He tries to grope her and go to her room, but a butler sends him back over to his room. Right after, Quaker goes to the door to sneak a peek on the two, but only finds the lone Ossi already sleeping with her teddy bear, at which he seems not impressed.  Nucki returns from the spree. The men are all drunk and stumble over to some benches to rest. Nucki deliriously stumbles over to speak to a horse on a carriage. That morning, Ossi attends the official breakfast for young women given by the Multi-Millionaires’ Daughters Association Against Dipsomania. They toast, “Down with dipsomania!” They then have their consulting hours, only because their patients will sober up by themselves if they don’t cure them first. All of their patients are these drunken old men. Nucki is driven over by the carriage, and is takes in to be helped. When the daughters see Nucki, the only handsome and young man, they go wild, and fight over him, which he doesn’t mind at all. They decide to have a boxing match to decide who will cure the man. The women file into a room already dressed in boxing attire, and fight to the last one. Ossi is the last one standing, and immediately falls for Nucki, the raving drunkard. She sneaks in a kiss, and then takes him to a ‘private treatment’ which just so happens to be in her bedroom. When Ossi leaves, Josef gets up and goes over to peek into Ossi’s room, only to find s man lying in her bed, so he runs to tell Quaker. Ossi returns to Nucki, her patient, and they flirt, and find that they are fond of each other. They kiss, but are upset because they want to be together but she has already been married, and he thinks he has to soon, so they burst out into tears. Josef bursts into the room and realizes that it’s Nucki and starts laughing uncontrollably. He asks them, “Do you know that you two are married to each other?“ and then explains to them that he has gotten married under Nucki’s name. Nucki and Ossi are so happy at this they kiss some more. The real wedding. This time around, it is just the Quaker, and the Bride and groom at a small table. Nucki and Ossi can hardly contain themselves, and escape off to her bedroom without Quaker even noticing. Once he notices that he is the only one left at the table, he goes to find them. He peeks into their room only to find them cuddling in bed. Quaker is so happy that the only thing he can say is, “Now I&#39;m impressed!”',\n",

Lisa frequently travels to Milan to do business with the Gianni & Gianni Company. The story then moves forward an unspecified amount of time, where Lisa has died. Peter is rooting around his house, in an attempt to rid himself of Lisa\\'s stuff, to help deal with the grief. Abigail takes one of her mother\\'s shoes and pulls a piece of paper out of it, saying it was for Peter to find. On the paper is written \"Lake Como\". Soon after this, Peter finds a strange message on her cell phone from a man, wishing only to hear Lisa\\'s voice. It creates a tension in the mind of Peter and he decides to check her e-mails and finds several similar requests in there too. He also finds a secret folder named “Love” on her Desktop which is password protected. It creates a strong suspicion in his mind that she had a secret love affair and that her lover is mailing her now. He tries to open the folder by breaking the password for several days, but in vain. He replies to the mails of “Ralph” pretending to be Lisa. He requests one of his trusted co-workers to find out the real name & exact location of the sender of these e-mails by tracing down his IP Address, through his email address, which is an offence. His co-worker tells him that Rafe’s real name is Ralph , who lives in Milan. Peter continues to try to access the \"love\" folder on Lisa\\'s computer, and becomes increasingly frustrated. In anger he types \"Lake Como\" and when he applies that as the password, the folder opens. It contains thousands of her photos & videos with Ralph in their passionate moments & near “Lake Como” where she first met Ralph. In order to find out more about his wife\\'s lover, he secretly locates and follows Ralph in Milan. He then goes to a Milanese Cafe, one of Ralph\\'s haunts, and begins to play chess alone. Ralph engages him in conversation, and they begin to play chess and talk. Ralph easily speaks about Lisa & their relationship, unaware that Peter is Lisa\\'s husband. Ralph tells him that it is he who has suggested she start a Shoe designing business after perceiving her unique understanding of shoes and her passion towards different new designs, which this industry lacks. Over a period of time, they play several games of chess and, as far as Ralph is concerned, have a friendship. Abigail learns of her mother\\'s affair, while listening to her mother\\'s voicemail, and deduces her father\\'s frightening obsession with vengeance. She goes to Milan and tries to convince her father to stop hunting for Lisa’s lover as she had already gone, as well as to accept her husband George . She also warns him that his craziness will lead him to lose everything . Peter becomes greatly upset and he goes uninvited, with murderous intent, to Ralph\\'s apartment. There, to his surprise, he learns that Ralph is not the cosmopolitan man of the world as he has been portraying himself, but an impoverished janitor. Peter\\'s hate diminishes, but not his urge to avenge. He sends an e-mail, as Lisa, to Ralph, asking that he meet her at Lake Como. Ralph tells Peter about his upcoming meeting, and Peter gives him money to enable the meeting. Ralph also plans to throw a party for Lisa in London, as he sees this latest meeting as a sign that their relationship is taking off. Ralph goes to Lake Como, but instead of finding Lisa there, Ralph finds Peter waiting for him, and Peter reveals to Ralph that he was Lisa\\'s husband, and that Lisa is actually dead. Ralph tells Peter that Lisa had known about his humble origins and poor socio-economic background. She also helped him financially on several occasions. He also forces Peter to confront that it is his excessive devotion for his work & cold nature towards marital life, which had moved Lisa to seek warmth in Ralph\\'s arms, but still loving Peter so much that she never was ready to leave him, in spite of cheating with Ralph. Throughout this conversation, it is shown through flashbacks that Lisa died of cancer, and that she did not tell Peter about it until \\'it was too late\\'. It is then revealed that, when Lisa was about to die due to critical illness, she wrote something on a piece of paper and asked her daughter to put it in her red shoes so that one day Peter would find it. But Lisa instructs Abigail not to tell him about the letter. Abigail asks how he would find the message when he doesn\\'t even know about its existence, but she replies that he will definitely look for it and find it on his own one day. This is the piece of paper with \"Lake Como\" on it from earlier. When Ralph asks her to tell Peter about their affair, end their marriage and move in with him, Lisa refused, saying that she did not want to hurt Peter and make him endure the pain of separation. She promised to reveal her dark secret to Peter at the appropriate time in her life so that he can forgive her for her infidelity. Peter and Ralph part, with Peter seemingly more bitter and angry than ever. Ralph has arranged a dinner in Lisa\\'s memory, and at first, Peter refuses to go. However, he realizes that “forgiveness and love need to replace hate”, and arranges to be at the dinner with Abigail and her husband. Traveling home after the dinner, we see Peter reconciled with George, Abigail\\'s husband.',\n",

When Esmeralda accidentally spills a goblet of wine, one of Prospero\\'s guests, Alfredo, strikes her. Prospero frightens Francesca with his coldness and attempts to corrupt her, in order to destroy her faith in God. He shows her a succession of different coloured rooms, but warns her not to enter the Black Room while she is still \\'uninvited\\'. Juliana expresses her wish to Prospero to be initiated in to his Satanic cult, and, that night, Francesca is terrified to discover Juliana and Prospero lying in a strange, hypnotic state in the Black Room. Gino, meanwhile, is being held prisoner in Prospero\\'s castle, with the castle guards teaching him armed combat so that he can fight to the death against Ludovico as entertainment for the nobility. While Prospero further attempts to seduce Francesca, Juliana performs a ritual in the Black Room, pledging her soul to Satan. Francesca is horrified to learn of her actions, but Juliana gives Francesca the key to Ludovico and Gino\\'s cell, and tells her to leave. During their escape, Gino and Ludovico kill three guards, and are then recaptured by Prospero, who points out to Francesca how her father and Gino have sinned. At a grand feast, Prospero summons Gino and Ludovico. As they refuse to fight each other, he instead has them each choose daggers to cut themselves with. One of the daggers is coated with poison, and, upon choosing the last dagger  Ludovico attempts to stab Prospero with it, but Prospero stabs him through the heart with his sword. He then casts Gino out of the castle, leaving him to be killed by the Red Death. Gino runs away through the woods, and encounters the red-cloaked figure, who presents him with a Tarot card, which he says represents mankind. Juliana is then put through her final initiation ceremony, where she drinks from a chalice, and suffers a terrifying hallucination  involving wild, dancing figures that stab at her as she lies prostrate on a table. Awakening from her dream, Juliana then declares herself the wife of Satan, proud that she has \\'survived her own sacrifice\\'. She wanders out through the coloured rooms, and is viciously attacked and killed by a crow. Prospero comments that Juliana is now truly married to Satan. Meanwhile, Hop-Toad, enraged by Alfredo\\'s previous ill-treatment of Esmeralda, plans his revenge by persuading Alfredo to wear an ape costume to Prospero\\'s grand masked ball, where Prospero has instructed that no one is to wear red. In the guise of the ape\\'s trainer, Hop-Toad cruelly humiliates Alfredo in front of the assembled guests, before soaking him with brandy and setting him on fire. Prospero rewards Hop-Toad for his amusing \\'entertainment\\'. Outside the castle walls, Gino returns to rescue Francesca, and once again encounters the red-cloaked figure. The figure tells him not to enter the castle, and promises that he will send Francesca out to Gino shortly. Amid the general atmosphere of debauchery and depravity at the ball, Prospero notices the entry of the mysterious, red-cloaked figure. He and Francesca follow the figure through in to the Black Room, where Prospero believes the figure to be an ambassador of Satan. He asks to see the figure\\'s face, but the figure tells Prospero that \"There is no face of Death until the moment of your own death.\" As the ball is transformed into a danse macabre, Prospero asks for Francesca to be given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure appears to consent to his request, and sends Francesca outside, where he knows Gino is waiting. Before leaving, Francesca sadly kisses Prospero. The red-cloaked figure then reveals that he is not a servant of Satan  and tells Prospero that his beliefs will not save him, declaring that \"Each man creates his own God for himself - His own Heaven, his own Hell.\" Prospero rips off the figure\\'s red mask to reveal Prospero\\'s own blood-spattered face. The figure is the Red Death himself - Prospero\\'s \\'own Hell\\', and the \\'moment of his death\\'. Prospero attempts to flee through the now infected crowd, but his red-cloaked self is always in front of him. The Red Death finally corners Prospero in the Black Room, asking, \"Why should you be afraid to die? Your soul has been dead for a long time\", and strikes him down. In an epilogue, the Red Death is seen playing with his Tarot cards with a young child. Other similarly cloaked figures then gather around him, each wearing a different colour: the \"White Death\", the \"Yellow Death\", the Golden Death, the Blue Death, the Violet Death and the \"Black Death\". They discuss among themselves the numbers of people each of them had \\'claimed\\' that night, each accepting of their endless terrible task. When asked of his work, the Red Death says to them, \"I called many...Peasant and prince...The worthy and the dishonoured. Six only are left.\" Among the surviving six are Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl that the Red Death plays cards with, and an old man from a nearby village. The Red Death declares \"Sic transit gloria mundi\"  and the cloaked figures file offscreen in a grim procession. Over the procession are Poe\\'s words: \"And darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all\".',\n",
              " 'Set in the 22nd century, the film opens with the destruction of a space cruise liner that collides with a meteor. The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women – Nova , Reena , and Meagan  – who get away in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails. In space, an alert goes out for the safe return of the women with a reward of 3,000 \"mega-credits\". A small time salvage operator named Wolff  intercepts the message and heads to the planet. Joining him is his female engineer Chalmers , who learns the planet – called Terra XI – is a failed colony that fell victim to a deadly plague and civil warfare. Wolff risks the dangers believing the reward will solve his debt problems. After landing on the barren world, Wolff and Chalmers set out in a 4-wheel drive vehicle called the \"Scrambler\". Soon, they join a battle in progress between a group of marauders  and a band of nomads . The Zoners take the women before Wolff can stop them and fly away on jet-powered hang-gliders. Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into \"The Zone\" which is ruled by \"Overdog\" – their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds Chalmers –\\xa0who is really an android –\\xa0has been \"killed\". Wolff continues on alone, but soon catches a teenage Scav named Niki  trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead. In the meantime, the three women are taken before \"The Chemist\" , the chief henchman of Overdog who administers pacifying drugs to the girls and prepares them for Overdog\\'s pleasure. Elsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his – a soldier named Washington , who reveals he too has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off world. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself. Back in The Zone, the women are taken to see the Overdog , who is revealed to be a hideous cyborg, almost entirely machine, with two metal claws for hands. Still led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments – from being attacked by mutated blob-like beings, to strange mermaid-like women and their giant water dragon. He even loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. Washington assists, but only if Wolff cuts him in 50/50 on the reward. Wolff and Washington team up and sneak into Overdog\\'s fortress where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki  decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end where Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy in turn recharges Overdog. Wolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog\\'s claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the complex explodes, the three heroes, and the three rescued women, manage to get away. In the end, Wolff invites Niki to stay with him and she agrees since they made good partners.',\n",

Dhanushkodi, the Indo-Sri Lankan border town, is the crucible wherein History is brewing this concoction of defeated lives and exhausted dreams. Hope is a big word and resistance but a tired expression. Three decades of struggle for a nation is washed out, a race obliterated. For, there is no one fighting their war back home now. Heroic images have turned to dust. The bunkers run with the wasted blood. Smoke rises from heaps of putrid flesh. Unwanted lives rot away in barbed wire human zoos. The misery spills over to the Indian shore. Fishermen fishing in fear in ignorance of friendly and enemy waters get dumped as rebels, spies and smugglers and unceremoniously beaten to death or shot or maimed. Yet, each morning sees their boats launched once again to the sea as the sea is their motherland and the language of fish their mother tongue. Manimekalai, the filmmaker, Munusamy, the fisherman, Rosemary, the social worker in Jesuit Christian Refugee Services, try hard to retain their sanity in this mad jumble. Their interactions with the dead or living refugees, their skirmishes with the Indian and Sri Lankan States, their personal lives overrun by external events - form the kernel of this narration. Soori, a half-wit Sri Lankan Tamil, who connects to the world through his radio, stands aloof in this bleak world of despair sending lightning jolts of truth into the dark recesses of History. No wonder, he vanishes into the blue and Manimekalai is forced by the State to return to the world of civil obedience.

              " 'The Piano tells the story of a mute Scotswoman, Ada McGrath , whose father sells her into marriage to a New Zealand frontiersman, Alistair Stewart . She is shipped off along with her young daughter Flora McGrath . The voice that the audience hears is not her speaking voice, but her mind\\'s voice. Ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old, expressing herself instead through her piano playing and through sign language for which her daughter has served as the interpreter. Ada cares little for the mundane world, occupying herself for hours every day with the piano. It is never made explicitly clear why she ceased to speak. Flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher whom Ada believed she could control with her mind, making him love her, but who \"became frightened and stopped listening,\" and thus left her. Ada, Flora, and their belongings, including the piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by the ship\\'s crew against her angry objections. As there is no one there to meet them, they spend the night alone, sheltering under a tiny tent made of a hoop skirt frame. The following day, Alistair arrives with a Māori crew and his friend Baines , a fellow forester and a retired sailor, who has adopted many of the Māori customs, including tattooing his face and socializing with the Māori instead of his own race . There are insufficient men to carry everything and Alistair abandons the piano, again eliciting objections from Ada. Alistair proves to be a shy and diffident man, who is jokingly called \"old dry balls\" by his Māori cohorts. He tells Ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano. Ada, in turn, makes no effort to befriend him and continues to try to be reunited with her piano. Unable to communicate with Alistair, she goes, with Flora, to Baines and asks to be taken to the piano. He agrees, and the three spend the day as she plays tunes on the beach. While he socially aligns himself with the Māori, Baines has steadfastly refused any sexual activity with Māori women. But he clearly finds Ada attractive due to her passion for music. Baines eventually retrieves the instrument and suggests that Alistair trade it{{mdash}}and lessons from Ada{{mdash}}for some land that Alistair wants. Alistair consents, oblivious to the budding attraction between Ada and Baines. She is surprised to find that he has had the piano put into perfect tune after its rough journey. He asks to simply listen rather than learn to play himself, and then offers to let her buy the piano back, one key at a time, by letting him do \"things he likes\" while she plays. Ada reluctantly agrees, as she is attracted to Baines. Ada and Alistair have had no sexual, or even mildly affectionate, interaction even though they are betrothed to marry. Baines is sexually aroused by Ada\\'s playing to the point that he openly approaches her. Finally, she yields to her own desire one afternoon, and she and Baines have intercourse. Alistair finally begins to suspect the love affair and after discovering them, he angrily boards up his home with Ada inside when he goes off to work on his timberland. After that interlude, Ada avoids Baines and feigns affection with Alistair, though her caresses only serve to frustrate him more because when he makes a move to touch her in return, she pulls away. Before Alistair departs on his next journey, he asks Ada if she will go to see Baines{{mdash}}she shakes her head no{{mdash}}and he tells her he trusts that she won\\'t go to him while he\\'s gone. Soon after, Ada sends her daughter with a package for Baines, containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration that says \"dear George, you will have my heart, Ada McGrath\". Flora has begun to accept Alistair as her \"papa\" and is angered by her mother\\'s infidelity. She brings the piano key instead to Alistair. After reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, Alistair furiously returns home and cuts off Ada\\'s index finger with an axe to deprive her of the ability to play her piano. He then sends Flora to Baines with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, with the message that if Baines ever attempts to see Ada again, he will chop off more fingers. After Ada recovers from her injury, Alistair sends her and Flora away with Baines and dissolves their marriage. They depart from the same beach on which she first landed in New Zealand. While being rowed to the ship with her baggage and the piano tied onto a Maori longboat, Ada feels that the piano is ruined as she can no longer play and insists that Baines throw the piano overboard. As it sinks, she deliberately puts her foot into the loop of rope trailing overboard. She is rapidly pulled deep underwater connected by the rope to the piano{{mdash}}but then she changes her mind and kicks free to be pulled back into the boat. In an epilogue, she describes her new life with Baines and Flora in Nelson, where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home, and her severed finger has been replaced with a silver finger made by Baines. Ada says that she imagines her piano in its grave in the sea, and herself suspended above it, which \"lulls me to sleep.\" Ada has also started to take speech lessons in order to learn how to speak again. The film closes with the Thomas Hood quote, from his poem \"Silence,\" which also opened the film: \"There is a silence where hath been no sound. There is a silence where no sound may be in the cold grave under the deep deep sea.\"',\n",

After a tangle with an exploding shark which seizes Batman\\'s leg but is repelled by Shark Repellent Bat-Spray after the Yacht disappears, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon\\'s office where, through deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by The United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City , who plan to defeat The Dynamic Duo once and for all, and take over the entire world. The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust , a World War II \"Pre-Atomic\" Submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen , and Batman and Robin must stop them. It is revealed the ship was really a projection. When The Dynamic Duo return to the buoy via The Batboat with the projector on it, they are trapped on it by a magnet and torpedoes are launched at them, but they escape using a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise is hit by the last one. Catwoman, disguised as the Soviet journalist \"Miss KITKA\" , lures Bruce Wayne into a trap as part of a plot to destroy Batman, little suspecting that Wayne is Batman\\'s alter-ego. And Penguin, disguised as the Commodore even schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen; this plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into Antimatter when Penguin mistakenly rehydrates them with heavy water contaminated with radioactive waste, regularly used to recharge the Batcave\\'s atomic pile. Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization\\'s Security Council. After giving chase in the Batboat, the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder use a sonic charge weapon called \"Bat-Charges\" to disable Penguin\\'s submarine and bring it to the surface, where a grand fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when she trips and her mask falls off. Although Commodore Schmidlapp sneezes on and scatters the powdered members of the dehydrated Council, mixing them together &ndash; which would normally spell their doom &ndash; Batman constructs an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin poses the question whether it might not be in the world\\'s best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so—in reminder of the fate of Penguin\\'s five henchmen\\'s tainted rehydration—and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own. However, in the final scene, Robin\\'s wishes are ironically fulfilled when the Security Council is improperly re-hydrated. All of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings. But each of them now speaks the language - and displays the stereotypical mannerisms - of a nation other than their own. As the world looks on in disbelief at this development, Batman and Robin quietly climb out of the United World Headquarters to an uncertain future. Batman\\'s final words express his sincere hope that this \"mixing of minds\" does more good than it does harm. The Fins shows \"The Living{?} End\"',\n",

Teridax then banished the mask into orbit, in order to prevent Mata Nui from interfering with his takeover of the Matoran Universe. The mask crash lands on a planet called Bara Magna, a remote, decaying wasteland of scrap parts and burnished metals. A Scarabax beetle watches as the Mask of Life creates a body for Mata Nui, who almost steps on the Scarabax. He picks up the Scarabax, who touches his mask. Upon doing so, the beetle changes into a living weapon. Just then, a being called a Vorox attacks Mata Nui and after a struggle, flees without its stinger, which has fallen off. Mata Nui picks up the stinger as a vehicle carrying a villager named Metus  speeds towards him. The fast-talking Agori recruiter takes Mata Nui to Vulcanus as he tells the once ruler about life on Bara Magna. Local villages scavenge for what remains, building shelters, survival gear and ultimately arenas where they can settle their disputes. Putting the best Glatorian from each village against one another, tribes can quickly end quarrels based on the outcome of the fight. Metus introduces Mata Nui to Raanu , the Agori leader of Vulcanus, who is too interested in the fight between veteran fighter Strakk  and Vulcanus\\' prime Glatorian, Ackar , to talk. Strakk eventually falls in battle, but gets up and fells Ackar after conceding, a move that gets him banned from the fights. Mata Nui intervenes and gets beaten down by the angry Strakk. As Mata Nui tries to use the stinger to defend himself, the mask transforms it into a sword. Mata Nui quickly defeated Strakk, gaining Ackar as a friend in the process. Metus later attempts to recruit Mata Nui, who refuses. Ackar introduces the hero to Kiina , a feisty Glatorian from the village of Tajun. In exchange for showing the two Glatorians a secret cavern underneath Tajun, Kiina would like to leave Bara Magna with Mata Nui, believing that anywhere is better than her native planet. On their way to Tajun, the three Glatorians are ambushed by a Skopio beast, along with a group of Bone Hunters, who were told the Glatorians location by an Agori traitor. After trapping both beneath a rockslide, they discover that Tajun had been raided by the combined efforts of the formidable Skrall army and the Bone Hunters, despite the fact that the two forces were rival tribes. A Glatorian rookie, Gresh , had been trying to defend the village and was badly injured. The heroes follow Kiina to the caverns, where they encounter Berix , a thief. While Berix tends to Gresh, the other three discover a hidden chamber containing a picture of the robot that was once Mata Nui\\'s body. As the Glatorians leave, Gresh complains about his weapon being damaged, then Ackar wonders if what Mata Nui did with Click  and the Vorox tail would work with the Glatorian weapons . Mata Nui successfully repairs and transforms the weapons. In addition, these weapons grant the Glatorian elemental abilities of fire, water, and air for Ackar, Kiina, and Gresh, respectively. The three practice their newfound powers as they travel to Gresh\\'s village, Tesara, while Ackar teaches Mata Nui to stay alert in battle and to study and find his opponent\\'s weakness. To the protests of Raanu and Metus, the four Glatorian stop a fight between Vastus  and Tarix , telling the crowd of Agori that they must unite their villages against the threat of the Skrall—Bone Hunter alliance. Mata Nui proves his worth to the crowd by transforming Tarix\\'s and Vastus\\' weapons. In the hot springs not far from Tesara, Kiina follows a mysterious figure. It turns out to be Berix. Kiina is now convinced that Berix is the traitor. But then, the actual traitor corrects Kiina. The two are then captured by the Bone Hunters and the true traitor. Back in Tesara, Raanu and Metus alert the Glatorian about Kiina and Berix\\'s kidnapping. Mata Nui ignores Ackar\\'s and Gresh\\'s offers for assistance and sets off for the Skrall camp on his own. Kiina and Berix are held in a suspended cage near the mouth of a cave at the Skrall camp, both arguing about the former\\'s caverns. Mata Nui confronts Tuma, the Skrall leader and challenges him to a one-on-one fight, and eventually defeats him. As he claims Tuma\\'s shield in victory and frees Kiina and Berix, the traitor, now revealed to be Metus, appears. He explains how he got the nomads and the Skrall to unite under him. Now in control of the army, he orders the Skrall and Bone Hunters to kill off the three. Just then, the Skrall and Bone Hunters are attacked by an immense being in the shape of Malum, composed of Scarabax beetles. Mata Nui gives Berix Tuma\\'s shield, and after lots of chaos, defeats a pack of bone hunters. Mata Nui sees Metus fleeing in his vehicle and follows him. A couple of unchained and vengeful Vorox overturn Metus\\' chariot, sending him tumbling to the feet of Mata Nui. Mata Nui picks him up and, despite Metus\\' attempt to bargain with him , presses the traitor to his mask, transforming Metus into a snake as a representation of what he truly is. As he slithered away, he claims that his united army cannot be defeated. Realizing this to be the key to winning, Mata Nui has the Glatorians combine their powers against the waves of Skrall and Bone Hunters. As the defeated army flees, the Glatorian rejoice, except for Kiina, who believes Berix to be killed in battle. She quickly finds him alive under a pile of rocks holding a Skrall shield. As the Glatorian and Berix watch the combined efforts of the Agori and the Scarabax beetles pulling the villages together, they notice that the combined villages formed a large robotic body, similar to the one Mata Nui\\'s spirit once inhabited. To further this, Berix pulls out a coin with the Unity-Duty-Destiny symbol, the Bara Magna symbol, and the Mask of Life symbol on one side, and the Skrall symbol on the other. Berix shows them the Skrall shield and acknowledges that they are both similar to each other and that the mazelike symbol forms a map. With this information in hand, Ackar, Kiina, Gresh, and Berix prepare to set off for their next adventure with a legend... reborn.',\n",

As the freelancing protector of the black community, Undercover Brother  fights this organization\\'s efforts to subdue the spread of black culture. In addition to the endeavors of Undercover Brother, an organization known as the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. battles The Man to ensure the continuance of black culture.

Before Sistah Girl can relay all of the data back to the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., Undercover Brother decommissions a computer unit, ending Sistah Girl\\'s infiltration. As Undercover Brother escapes security with the help of Sistah Girl. After hearing Sistah Girl describe the incident in explanation of why she failed the mission, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D.\\'s Chief , is left in bewilderment. The Man is infuriated that Gen. Warren Boutwell , a U.S. Army general based on Colin Powell, is considering running for president, and his lackey Mr. Feather  informs him of a mind control drug which The Man uses to make Boutwell abort his plans and instead open a fried chicken franchise. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. is quick to determine that this sudden change of heart is the work of The Man and recruits Undercover Brother for assistance. He is introduced to Conspiracy Brother , Smart Brother , The Chief, and Lance , an intern who is the only white man in the organization due to affirmative action. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. convinces Undercover Brother to go undercover in white culture as a new employee at a cigarette company owned by The Man. Through surveillance, Mr. Feather discovers Undercover Brother\\'s identity as an infiltrator and deploys his secret weapon that he calls \"Black Man\\'s Kriptonite\": White She-Devil . Posing as another new employee, she and Undercover Brother meet and start dating, and she begins to make him do stereotypical \"white\" things, such as buying corduroy and khaki clothes, singing karaoke and adopting a silly set of euphemisms.

They go to The Man\\'s base, following the signal of a transmitter placed on Brown. The group goes undercover as a Jamaican cleaning service to procure Brown and \"The Candidate\", a controlled black man that the organization will use to land a crushing blow to black culture. Mr. Feather receives a message from The Man himself stating that he will arrive on the island soon, and prepares to administer the drug to Brown and present him as a trophy to The Man. However, Brown starts to sing \"Say It Loud - I\\'m Black and I\\'m Proud\", forcing Mr. Feather to acknowledge his hidden blackness, and Brown then reveals himself as Undercover Brother in disguise. Mr. Feather sends his henchmen after the infiltrators, who discover the Candidate is Boutwell, and is ordered by Mr. Feather to kill Undercover Brother while he escapes.

Harris is initially condescending to the mild-mannered Beaseley, but by the time he finishes his story, Harris is apologetic. Harris\\'s investigations reveal Fuller\\'s relationship with Carol Larson , the alcoholic vocalist on his show, and various conflicts of interest involving his relationship with various song publishers whose songs were performed on Fuller\\'s program. Fuller bandleader Eddie Brand , hoping to remain on what he, too, suspects will become Harris\\' show, dutifully records an artificially sincere sound bite regarding Fuller. Moore signs Harris to a contract, then reveals more of Fuller\\'s escapades. Carleton privately warns Harris of Moore\\'s duplicitous nature, telling the newsman that the network will spin his chances of becoming Fuller\\'s successor negatively so Moore agrees to release him from the contract, adding if Harris cannot secure a release, the network will turn elsewhere. Amassing the research into a script, Harris has to choose between praising the beloved, amusing and warm-hearted Fuller the public saw or unmasking the phony beneath the image. Harris makes up his mind as the broadcast starts, throwing away his prepared script to tell the truth about Herb Fuller. As Carleton and Moore listen in, Moore realizes what Harris is about to do. He rips up Harris\\' contract and demands Carleton stop the broadcast. Seeing that Moore has done precisely what he had hoped for, Carleton refuses to stop the broadcast, explaining that he can market Harris as a man of principle and honesty to the public just as easily as his network marketed Fuller\\'s phony image.',\n",

              " 'Novelist and college professor Larry Donner  struggles with writer\\'s block due to his resentment towards his ex-wife Margaret , who stole his book and garnered mainstream success and critical acclaim with it. His subsequent obsession with Margaret\\'s deception drives him half-mad and puts a severe strain on his relationship with his current lover, Beth Ryan , a fellow professor. Owen Lift  is a timid, middle-aged man who still lives with his overbearing, abusive mother . Owen fantasizes of killing his mother but can\\'t summon the courage to bring his desires into fruition. As a student in Larry\\'s community college writing class, Owen is given advice by Larry to view an Alfred Hitchcock film to gain some insight into plot development. He happens to see Strangers on a Train, in which two strangers conspire to commit a murder for each other, figuring their lack of connection to the victim will, in theory, establish a perfect alibi. Having overheard Larry\\'s public rant that he wish his ex-wife dead, Owen forms a plan to kill Margaret, believing that Larry will, in return, kill his mother. He tracks Margaret down to Hawaii and follows her onto a cruise ship, apparently pushing her overboard while she tries to retrieve an earring that fell out. Owen returns from Hawaii to tell Larry of Margaret\\'s death and that Larry now \"owes\" him the murder of his mother, lest he inform the police that Larry was the killer. After having spent the night drinking alone during the hours of Margaret\\'s disappearance, Larry panics because he lacks a sufficient alibi. That, along with a news report announcing that the police suspect foul play, convinces Larry that he\\'s the prime suspect. He decides to stay with Owen and his mother in an attempt to hide from the police. Larry meets Mrs. Lift, but despite her harsh treatment of him he refuses to kill her. Eventually, when Mrs. Lift drives Owen to breaking point, Larry finally relents and agrees to go through with the murder. The first attempt involves Larry smothering Mrs. Lift with a pillow while Owen is out bowling, but Larry backs down when he sees her eyes open, and narrowly avoids being seen by the police when they come by to question Owen about Larry\\'s whereabouts. The second attempt involves Larry pushing Mrs. Lift down the basement staircase through the door which Owen earlier loosens, but it fails when Mrs. Lift bangs the door and it stays still. Larry tries the trap, but it is sprung and he is apparently killed, to Mrs. Lift\\'s amusement. In retribution, Owen tries killing Mrs. Lift himself by blowing a trumpet in her ear to give her a heart attack. The noise wakes Larry up and they both inspect Mrs. Lift, but she suddenly wakes up and knocks Larry out in her delusion. Eventually, Larry flees the Lift home when Mrs. Lift recognizes him as a suspect from a news broadcast about his ex-wife\\'s disappearance. He boards a train to Mexico and, surprisingly, Owen and Mrs. Lift come along so as to avoid having to lie for him. During the journey, Larry\\'s patience with Mrs. Lift reaches its pinnacle when she impolitely gives him advice on writing. He follows her to the caboose with the intent of throwing her from the train, but Owen begins having second thoughts about having his mother killed and gives chase. In the ensuing fight, Mrs. Lift falls from the train but is rescued by Owen and a repentant Larry. Mrs. Lift is grateful at her son for saving her, but unappreciative of Larry\\'s help and kicks him, resulting in him losing his balance, landing on the tracks, and breaking his leg. During his recovery in the hospital, Larry discovers that Margaret is still alive; she simply fell overboard by accident and was rescued by a Polynesian fisherman whom she has decided to marry. Much to his annoyance, Larry learns that Margaret plans to sell the rights of her ordeal for $1.5 million dollars. On the advice of a fellow patient, Larry chooses to free himself of his obsession with his ex-wife and instead focus on his own life, thereby freeing him of his writer\\'s block, making him a happier man and mending his relationship with Beth. A year later, Larry has finished a novel based on his experiences with Owen and Mrs. Lift entitled Throw Momma from the Train. Owen visits and informs him that his mother has died  and that he\\'s going to New York City for the release of his own book. Unfortunately for Larry, Owen reveals that his book is also about their experiences together.

Months later, Larry, Owen, and Beth holiday together in Hawaii, reflecting on the final chapter of Larry\\'s book.

Feeling stressed from writing his play, he decides to take a break and travels out of town to the Grand Hotel. While looking at a display in the hotel\\'s museum, Richard becomes enthralled by a photograph of a beautiful woman. With the assistance of Arthur Biehl , an old bellhop who has been at the hotel since 1910, Richard discovers that the woman is Elise McKenna , a famous early 20th century stage actress. Upon digging deeper, Richard learns that she was the aged woman who gave him the pocket watch eight years earlier. Traveling to McKenna\\'s home, he discovers a music box she had made, in the shape of the Grand Hotel, that plays his favorite melody. He also discovers among her effects a book on time travel written by his old college professor, Dr. Gerard Finney , and learns that McKenna read the book several times. Richard becomes obsessed with the idea of traveling back to 1912 and meeting Elise McKenna, with whom he has fallen in love. Visiting Finney, Richard learns that the man believes that he himself very briefly time traveled once to 1571 through the power of self-suggestion. To accomplish this feat of self-hypnosis, Finney tells Richard, one must remove from sight all things that are related to the current time and trick the mind into believing that one is in the past. He also warns that such a process would leave one very weak, perhaps dangerously so. Richard buys an early 20th century suit and some vintage money and cuts his hair in a time-appropriate style. Dressing himself in the suit, he removes all modern objects from his hotel room and attempts to will himself into the year 1912 using tape-recorded suggestions, only to fail for lack of real conviction. Later, while searching the hotel\\'s attic, Richard finds an old guest book from 1912 with his signature in it and realizes that he will eventually succeed. Richard again hypnotizes himself, this time with the tape recorder hidden under the bed, and allows his absolute faith in his eventual success to become the trigger for the journey back through time. He drifts off to sleep and awakens to the sound of whinnying horses on June 27, 1912. Richard looks all over the hotel for Elise, even meeting Arthur as a little boy, but he has no luck finding her. Finally, he stumbles upon Elise walking by a tree near the lake. She seems to swoon slightly at the sight of him, but then suddenly asks him if he is \"the one\". McKenna\\'s manager, William Fawcett Robinson , abruptly intervenes and sends Richard away. Richard stubbornly continues to pursue Elise until she finally agrees to accompany him on a stroll through the surrounding idyllic landscape. Richard ultimately asks why Elise wondered aloud if he was \"the one\". She replies that Robinson somehow knows that she will meet a man one day who will change her life forever. Richard then shows Elise the same pocket watch which she will eventually give him in 1972, but he does not reveal its origin, merely saying it was a gift. Richard accepts Elise\\'s invitation to her play, where she recites an impromptu monologue dedicated to him. During intermission, he finds her posing formally for a photograph. Upon spotting Richard, Elise breaks into a radiant smile, the camera capturing the image which Richard first saw of her 68 years later. Afterwards, Richard receives an urgent message from Robinson requesting a meeting. Robinson tries to get Richard to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. When Richard professes his love for her, Robinson has him tied up and locked in the stables. Later, Robinson tells Elise that Richard has left her and is not the one, but she disbelieves him, stating that she loves Richard. Richard wakes up the next morning and escapes his constraints. He runs to Elise\\'s room and finds that her party has left. Despondent, he goes out to the hotel\\'s porch. Suddenly, he hears Elise calling his name and sees her running towards him. They return to his room together and make love. The next morning they agree to marry. Elise tells him that the first thing she will do for him is buy him a new suit, since the one he has been wearing is about fifteen years out of date. Richard begins to show her how practical the suit is because of its many pockets. He is alarmed when he reaches into one and finds a Lincoln penny with a mint date of 1979. Seeing an item from his real present wrenches him out of his hypnotically-induced time trip, and Richard feels himself rushing backwards with Elise screaming his name in horror as he is pulled inexorably out of 1912. Richard then wakes up back in the present. He is drenched in sweat and very weak, apparently exhausted from his trip through time and back. He scrambles desperately back to his own room and tries to hypnotize himself again, without success. Heartbroken and after wandering around the hotel property and sitting interminably at the places where he spent time with Elise, he eventually retires to his room and remains there unmoving for days until discovered by Arthur and the hotel manager; they send for a doctor and paramedics. Richard suddenly smiles and sees himself drifting above his body and, having presumably died of a broken heart, is drawn to a light shining through the nearby window, where he is reunited with Elise.',\n",
              " 'This remake follows the same basic concept as the original: Santa, disillusioned by children\\'s lack of belief in him and in the spirit of giving, decides not to deliver toys this Christmas Eve, despite the arguments by Mrs. Claus and two of his helper-elves, Jingle and Jangle. They decide to provide Santa with some proof that children still believe and that they still deserve toys from Santa, so the elves visit the United States in search of Christmas spirit. They face setbacks both in South Town, which is celebrating its annual Winter Festival, and in their dealings with the jealous, competitive Miser Brothers, who refuse to compromise long enough to permit a Christmas snow in the southern town. Finally, Santa\\'s faith in children is renewed with the help of the boy Iggy Thistlewhite.  The most obvious differences are in the setting, which is moved to the 21st century present day, and the music, which is all but gone. Only the iconic \"Miser\" songs are retained . The remake also includes two subplots which do not appear in the original: The commercial coup of Santa\\'s toy-making operation by the ambitious elf Sparky, who wants a more modern and lucrative approach; and the family troubles of Iggy. His father  is too busy to focus on his family, even at Christmas. Mayor Thistlewhite is a foil both for Santa, in his journey to rediscover the Christmas spirit, and for Sparky, in his efforts to sell out the town\\'s historic district to an out-of-town commercial enterprise. In addition, the movie attempts to give more depth to the relationship between Mrs. Claus and Santa. Another difference is that it is Santa who sees the Miser Brothers about having it snow in South Town instead of Mrs. Claus. Like in the original, the brothers refuse to cooperate, but change their minds when Santa threatens to go to their mother. A number of pop-culture references pepper the script, including a glimpse of the original Year without a Santa Claus special on Jingle\\'s portable TV.The Year Without a Santa Claus   - Trivia Faced with the prospect of losing his job because of Santa\\'s retirement, Jingle muses that he could go to work for his cousin, who is a dentist; this refers to Hermey in Rankin-Bass\\' Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The script also works in a reference to A Christmas Story: When a disgruntled marksman tells Santa he wanted a gun last Christmas, Santa flatly remarks, \"You would\\'ve shot your eye out, kid!\" Then he comically mimics the marksman having  done just that.',\n",

              " 'In 1959, Louis Simo , a Los Angeles private investigator more interested in generating an income than in devotion to his clients, is helping out a client named Chester Sinclair by spying on Chester\\'s wife, under the impression that she is cheating on him, by taking pictures outside of a building she goes to from time to time. On a visit to see his son and ex-wife Laurie, Simo learns that his son is upset over the death of George Reeves, the actor who played Superman on television. Reeves was recently found dead inside his Beverly Hills home with a gunshot wound to the head, which lead the police to rule his death as suicide. Simo learns from a former colleague on the police force that the Reeves suicide has aspects that the cops don\\'t want to touch. Simo, sensing the potential for making a name for himself, begins investigating the case and notes several apparent conflicts with the official version of Reeves\\'s death. Simultaneously Simo bickers with Laurie over his failures as a father, particularly now when his son seems so troubled. In 1951, Reeves, a charming man whose acting career has stalled, catches the eye of a beautiful woman and they end the night in each other\\'s arms. In the morning, a newspaper photo reveals to Reeves that the woman is Toni Mannix, the wife of Eddie Mannix, the general manager of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Frightened that an affair with a studio boss\\'s wife will destroy what\\'s left of his career, Reeves is angry that Toni didn\\'t tell him. Toni, however, tells Reeves that she and Eddie have an open relationship and not to worry. The pair fall in love and the much wealthier Toni begins to buy Reeves expensive gifts such as a house, a car and jewelry. During their relationship Reeves gets the starring role in the television show Adventures of Superman. The role makes Reeves famous and gives him a steady income, but he longs for a more \"serious\" role and is uncomfortable with the public identification of him as Superman. As the years pass and Toni ages, Reeves becomes bitter at being a kept man and at Toni for not using her clout to help his career. He meets a young woman in New York, Leonore Lemmon, and leaves Toni for her. Toni is broken-hearted and furious, and Eddie seethes at her \"mistreatment\" by Reeves. Meanwhile, Simo initially suspects that Leonore Lemmon might have accidentally shot Reeves during an argument and imagines how the scenario might have played out. Later, Simo arrives back home to find thugs, who apparently were working for Eddie Mannix, in his house who beat Simo in hopes of scaring him off the case. This and other evidence lead Simo to suspect that Eddie had Reeves murdered and, again, Simo imagines what such an event might have looked like. Simo then learns that his client Chester Sinclair has murdered his wife because he got tired of waiting for information from Simo. A stricken and guilt-plagued Simo gets drunk and visits his son at school, but his inebriation scares the boy. Later, Simo visits Reeves\\' manager, Arthur Weissman. Weissman speaks highly of Reeves and his charm. He gives Simo a home movie Reeves had shot in hopes of promoting wrestling work. What Simo sees in the film suggests to him a sadness in Reeves, a weariness and humiliation with where his life has led. Simo\\'s final imagined variation on Reeves\\' death concludes with the actor shooting himself. This is the most vivid of the three scenarios, with Simo imagining himself standing in the corner of the upstairs bedroom, and even making eye contact briefly with the weary Reeves. Each of the scenes imagined by Simo begins with Reeves playing guitar and singing \"Aquellos Ojos Verdes\" in Spanish for his house guests. Reeves himself was fluent in Spanish. The Spanish lyrics of the popular song lament a love that can never be fulfilled. After each of the three imagined renditions, Reeves says goodnight to his guests, then retires to his bedroom upstairs, just before the gunshot. Reeves\\' quest for fame and success and Simo\\'s realization of how that quest is paralleled in his own existence causes the detective to re-evaluate his life. Simo watches another home movie, this one of himself and Laurie and their son in happier days. The film ends with Simo coming to Laurie\\'s house wearing a suit and tie, and greeting his son hopefully.',\n",
              " 'The film theorizes a conspiracy upheld by big government through money control by citing books as Tragedy and Hope by Carroll Quigley, Philip Dru: Administrator by Edward M. House, The Strawberry Statement by James Simon Kunen and The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The film is summarized in seven conclusions: # There is a conspiracy among some of the richest people in the non-communist nations and that its power is protected by their respective governments. That it is perpetuating its wealth by creating money out of nothing. # In the USA it is perpetuated through the Federal Reserve system. That although it appears that the executive branch controls them it is in fact the other way around. # The capitalist conspiracy in the USA surfaces in the Council on Foreign Relations that influence on the public through television, education and press. # The capitalist conspiracy opposes communism only on the surface because it needs the illusion of a foe. And because the chaos byproduct of the managed conflict advances its own goal of totalitarian world government. A tactic called \"pressure from above and below\" laid down in Edward M. House\\'s novel Philip Dru: Administrator deliberately create problems and frightful domestic and foreign conditions and provide solutions that result in publicly accepted government expansion at the expense of personal liberties and national sovereignty. # There is \"much evidence indicating\" that both the capitalist and communist conspiracy is directed by a single master conspiracy that may have continuity with The Illuminati, but that this historical question is not as important as what can be done about it. # The reaction to the conspiracies should be to dismantle the big government and localizing schools and police. # That the root of the evil is that money is created out of nothing. The solution is to reduce the power of the Federal Reserve and returning to the gold and silver standards and thus preventing anyone, in or out of government, to manipulate the money supply. Exposing the conspiracy to public view, by circumventing the establishment\\'s channels of mass communication, would cause it to collapse.',\n",

The gang of friends  is meant to have a blast on the road but the foolish gags and lukewarm dialogues slacken the pace.

Ben and Virgil are the quintessential Asian Americans, seen as highly intelligent overachievers whose only goal is to gain acceptance into the highly prestigious Ivy League universities. In fact, Ben learns a new SAT vocabulary word every night through rote memorization and recitation. These words act as the dividers between different chapters of Ben's life. In reality, Ben reveals that he in fact uses his perfectionism in order to act out in other ways, such as toilet papering houses with Virgil and other petty crimes. Part of these activities include the purchase and return of computer equipment with Virgil, and Virgil's cousin Han Seoul-Oh  to earn easy money. Ben is involved in many of the school clubs, all of which are being used to pad his college application. He makes the basketball team, though he soon discovers that he is merely a bench player.

Later, the group, now intoxicated, arrive at a party, where they are accosted by a football player who mocks them for their perfect image. A fight results in Daric pulling out a gun, stopping the fight. At school the next day, news of the fight spreads around school and the four’s notoriety increases. Theories run rampant, including a possible link to the Chinese mafia. They gradually expand into more and more dangerous scams, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and eventually, drugs. They become users themselves, and Ben begins to develop a heavy cocaine habit. They also throw wild parties at Daric's house, which results in their lives running wildly out of control. Ben accompanies Steve to a batting cage after selling him drugs. Steve expresses to Ben that he knows he should be happy with what he has, but he is not since he feels stifled by the expectations that others have of him. On his birthday, Ben wakes up with a nosebleed as a result of his cocaine use. This is enough to scare him into changing his life. He meets the remainder of the group and tells them that he wants to quit. Daric agrees with him, expressing that their operation has become a full-time job. Daric presents a gun from the three of them to Ben, wishing him a happy birthday. Virgil continues the operation on his own, but, without the influence of Daric or Ben, is soon discovered thanks to his own carelessness and bragging. Han is forced to take the blame for the cheat sheet operation and is suspended, but not before he proceeds to beat up Virgil. Ben begins to rebuild his life, studying hard again and engaging in volunteer activities once more. He also begins to spend more time with Stephanie, who reveals a wild side of her own when she gives him a CD [Music You Hump To] that she shoplifted. Ben gathers up the courage to ask Stephanie to the formal, to which she agrees. The four leave to Las Vegas for the Academic Decathlon championships.

The situation is made clear to Ben when Steve is seen outside of the formal, waiting to take Stephanie home. Steve meets Ben at the basketball court and tells him that he has information on a possible score. Though Ben is reluctant to re-enter his previous activities, he gathers up the group once more and meets Steve at his home. The group is stunned when they are informed that Steve wants them to rob his parents' house. He refers to it as a wake-up call. Ben and Han are against the plan, but Daric convinces them to participate, saying that this would be the perfect opportunity to give Steve his wake-up call. They agree Steve’s plan and practice constantly. They also agree to purchase Steve a gun. On New Year's Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus' house. With Ben acting as lookout, Han, Daric and Virgil begin attacking Steve. The lights go out as Virgil’s gun slips away from him. Steve lunges for the weapon and the struggle for the automatic results in it going off. Ben hears the shot and rushes into the garage. Ben beats Steve nearly to death, stopping only when Han yells to him. The four are stunned at what they just did and get Jesus to agree to allow them to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch. Daric soaks a rag in gasoline and, with a tearful Virgil holding him, suffocates Steve with it. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year's party, where they each split up. Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight, to which Stephanie tells an apologetic Ben that it is okay. The cell phone ring tone came from Steve's phone, which shows that the missed call was from Stephanie. Ben debates about whether or not to report Steve's murder to the police. The knowledge of his role in the murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts to commit suicide after calling over Han under the premise of watching some pornography. He survived the gunshot wound, but will most likely suffer brain damage. Daric arrives shortly after Ben, makes a flippant remark that angers Han and Ben escorts him out of the room. Daric expresses concern about the possibility of Han or Virgil revealing their secret. Ben simply resolves to do nothing and leaves Daric alone. With the group now permanently separated, Ben is alone at school. He goes to the basketball court but is unable to attempt a shot. On his way home, Stephanie pulls over in her new car and picks him up. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying she and Ben will continue their relationship. As they drive off, Ben's voice over tells the audience that he has no idea what is going to happen or what the other guys will do but all he knows is that there is no turning back.\",\n",

As they are leaving the man\\'s wife pleads with them not to abandon the dissidents still fighting against Saddam, but she is summarily shot by the Iraqi Republican Guard, and Archie decides they can\\'t just \"grab the gold and go.\" They free a group of Iraqi prisoners, including the dissident rebel leader, violating the cease-fire and triggering a firefight. They pull out just as Iraqi reinforcements arrive, and as they try to evade a mustard gas  attack the Americans blunder into a minefield and get separated. Iraqi soldiers capture Troy and a group of rebels rescue the remaining Americans and take them to their underground hideout, retrieving the bags containing the gold as they go. There, Conrad, Chief and Archie agree to help the rebels and their families reach the Iranian border, after they rescue Troy. Troy has been taken back to the bunker, and when he is thrown in a room full of Kuwaiti cell phones, he manages to call his wife back home and tells her to report his location to his local Army Reserve unit. His call is cut short when he is dragged to the same interrogation room where they found the rebel leader. Electrical wires are placed around his ears, and the Iraqi intelligence officer, Captain Saïd , explains that he learned interrogation techniques from the Americans and berates him about the hypocrisy of American involvement in the region. Troy is subjected to several electric shocks, and is finally forced to drink motor oil by Saïd, who lost his family during the American bombing of Baghdad. The Americans with the rebels go to a band of Iraqi Army deserters, who are persuaded to sell them luxury cars stolen from Kuwait. The cars are outfitted as Saddam\\'s entourage, in a ruse to scare away the bunker\\'s defenders, pretending that an enraged Saddam is coming to kill them for losing the gold. After storming the bunker they free Troy, who spares the life of his torturer, as well as more Shi\\'ite dissidents held in a dungeon. But a few of the soldiers who ran away return, and Conrad and Troy are shot. Conrad dies but Troy survives with a punctured lung, requiring a flutter valve in his chest to relieve pressure so he can breathe until they reach a hospital. Archie radios Walter, arranging transport and telling him to bring Adriana, while the hapless officers in camp try to locate the trio after getting the message from Troy\\'s wife. Each of the rebels is given a bar of gold and the rest is buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans will escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing. But the American officers arrive in helicopters and stop the group, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie, Troy and Chief nod to each other, and Archie proffers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. All of the soldiers are cleared of the charges thanks to Adriana Cruz\\'s reporting. Archie and Chief go to work as military advisers to action films, and Troy returns to his wife and baby, running his own carpet store. The stolen gold was returned to Kuwait, although they claimed that some was missing.',\n",
